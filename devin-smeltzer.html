Maybe they are not ready yet to begin a new phase of parenthood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fishing-stories-300x202.png><p>Besides his love life, Smeltzer is an adventurous person too. He prefers going fishing and makes relevant plans for outdoor destinations with his wife.</p><h2>Devin Smeltzer | Net Worth And Salary</h2><p>Smeltzer is a very hard-working and coachable player. He has been in this field since a very young age.

Previously, the salary amount was <strong>$5,55,000</strong> in 2019.</p><p>Smeltzer has made career earnings above <strong>$1,055,000.</strong> And if we really have to speculate his net worth in numbers. As reported by CelebsAgeWiki.com,</p><p>“Devin Smeltzer has an accumulated net worth of $5million as of 2023.”</p><p>Not to mention, Smeltzer owns a Ford, which superficially costs around <strong>$28,000</strong>; also, the price can be raised to millions of dollars depending upon the model.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Devin-with-his-wife-infront-of-their-house-300x294.png><p>He also owns a lavishing house in the US.

But, yes, he has posted a picture of him with his wife in front of his mansion in his Instagram profile.</p><p>Moreover, Smeltzer has endorsed many of the brands too. But the information regarding his endorsement incomes still remains undercover.</p><h2>Devin Smeltzer | Cancer Survivor</h2><p>This must be the most awaited section in his bio as many fans would like to know how he overcame this battle?</p><p>Smeltzer was diagnosed with pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma, a form of cancer, at the very tender age of nine. He constantly suffered abdominal pain and an urge to urinate most of the time.</p><p>Following that, his parents took him for the medication, and the reports were out “a grapefruit-sized mass connected to his prostate, pressing on his bladder.”</p><p>Very few people know, the night when he was diagnosed with pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma, he was supposed to play in the championship game of the Magnolia Tournament for his summer club team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/At-the-age-of-ten-while-battling-cancer-300x262.png><p>He was treated with surgery and chemotherapy at St. Christopher’s Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia.</p><p>His parents walked in from time to time and found him lanky, lying on the bed with a bald head and playing with a two-year-old leukemia patient.</p><p>But throughout the chemotherapy, he continued playing baseball; he had that urge to live life as close to normal, and so did his parents want. He did not want to feel merciful.</p><p>Here’s what Gregory Halligan, a pediatric oncologist at St. Christopher’s, has to say about him recalling his days of fighting cancer.</p><p>“He was a little older, and he would interact incredibly well with younger kids,” Halligan said. “He wasn’t a typical, egocentric 12-year-old.” Smeltzer fully recovered in 2012.</p><h3>Meeting Chase Utley</h3><p>While battling cancer, Devin’s little ray of sunshine was when he got a chance to meet former baseballer and six-time All-Star Chase Utley. He met Utley during a family trip at the Citizens Bank Park.&nbsp;</p><p>Smeltzer said in an interview that he will never forget that moment as it meant a lot to him. Furthermore, he met Chase again in 2018 as a Dodger pitcher and thanked Utley.&nbsp;</p><p>Devin said, “The picture of me and Chase has been in the living room for a long time. When I go back home, it’s always very humbling to see that picture because of where I’m at today. It’s crazy to believe that I was going through such a hard time at such a young age, and how far I’ve grown.”</p><p>Extremely humbled and proud by Smeltzer’s success, Chase said, “It’s a pretty special and unique story. I can’t even imagine what he was going through, what his parents were going through. Hopefully, at some point, he’ll be pitching at Dodger Stadium.”</p><p>Thereafter, the two hugged and clicked another picture together to mark how far they’ve both come. Furthermore, Devin works with the same organization through which he met Utley.&nbsp;</p><h3>Philanthropist</h3><p>“My story isn’t about me anymore. My story is about giving hope to other people. There was a kid, almost the same age as me. He didn’t make it.</p><p>The hardest thing about going through cancer is meeting all these amazing people, and those people passing away, and you move on. I remember Frankie.</p><p>There was Baby Lea, and it was hard to hear when she passed away. She was under 2. That’s the hard part. I beat cancer, but the battle is still there.</p><p>I’ll always have it. You have to help the people that have helped you — and there are a lot of people that have been there for me.” says Devin Smeltzer.</p><p>Smeltzer established a “strikeout” foundation during his senior year at Bishop Eustace, where he raised money to support people who are battling cancer.</p><p>Besides that, he also keeps revisiting St. Christophers Hospital just to spend time with the other kids, to make them feel good.</p><p>Moreover, he has also participated in an elite baseball camp that later turned into a fundraising foundation in Syracuse, NY. The camp has also attracted major league scouts and top high school players.</p><p>Eventually, the event raised above $35,000 for the first year and $50,000 for the next year. And the event beneficiated the St. Christophers Hospital too.</p><h2>Devin Smeltzer | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Coming to his social media presence, he is abundantly available on Instagram and Twitter. He is not that shy kind of person when it comes to giving an update of his life on Social Networking sites.</p><p>Smeltzer has a very moderate amount of followers but has a very loyal and supportive fanbase. He keeps posting about his personal life, travel stories, adventure tours, fishing times, outdoor destinations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Out-for-an-adventure-300x184.png><p>Why don’t we do something?
