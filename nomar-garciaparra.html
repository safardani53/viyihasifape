He loved playing baseball, soccer, and football.</p><p>Garciaparra’s love for sports was inherited from his parents. His mother was a great fan of USC’s running back, Anthony Davis. Therefore, she named her son Anthony.</p><p>Similarly, his father was also an admirer of sports and always encouraged Garciaparra to play baseball or any other game.</p><p>Anthony’s middle name (Nomar) is the reverse of his father’s name Ramon. Everyone called him Anthony until he went to school.</p><p>After he joined the school, Anthony was a common name there. Hence, he decided to use Nomar as his name.</p><p>At the age of 6, Garciaparra was fond of playing Tee-ball. He was so serious about the game that his friend’s parents actually started calling him “No-nonsense Nomar.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1_tOKmOH-Q3r2g8EiZzYP5wQ-1024x980.png><p>During his school days, Nomar excelled as a soccer and baseball player. However, baseball was always his favorite, even though he loved every sport.</p><p>Nomar was a keen learner. Even at 5 or 6, he always asked his father to teach him more about sports.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the father-son duo discussed sports and game strategies at the dinner table. Every afternoon Nomar practiced baseball to sharpen his skills.</p><p>And Nomar’s father paid him 25 cents for every hit simultaneously, penalizing him double for each he couldn’t hit.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Ramon Garciaparra is the reason behind Nomar Garciaparra’s success. His dedication to making his son a great player has actually paid off.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Nomar Garciaparra graduated from Saint John Bosco High School in Bellflower in 1991. The Milwaukee Brewers drafted him in the fifth round, but he never signed the contract.</p><p>Nomar was offered scholarships from various colleges for baseball and football.
