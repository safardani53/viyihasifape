in a state of rapid decline.</p><p>When <a href=#>Josh Duggar was sentenced to 151 months</a> in prison back in May of 2022, his father, Jim Bob, likely convinced himself that the worst was over, and he would eventually be able to win back his family’s wholesome reputation.</p><p>Needless to say, that hasn’t happened.</p><p>In fact, the Duggars are more reviled than ever these days, and they have no one to blame but themselves!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-104230794-683x1024.jpg><p>Yes, the initial fallout from the Josh sex scandals was bad, but in terms of the negative media attention, the events of 2023 might have hit the Duggar clan even harder!</p><p>First, <a href=#>the Amazon Prime documentary Shiny Happy People</a> exposed abuse and depravity within both the family and the Institute for Basic Life Principles — the shadowy, cult-like organization that helped to shape Jim Bob’s bizarre belief system.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, <a href=#>Jill Duggar published a memoir</a> in which she went into great detail about the trauma she endured growing up in such an authoritarian environment.</p><p>Along with other recent developments, these projects have placed the Duggars under a brighter spotlight than ever.</p><p>So here’s a brief refresher for those who might find themselves wondering about this very strange family.</p><img

id=h-how-many-kids-do-the-duggars-have>How many kids do the Duggars have?</h2><p>As indicated by the title of their now-defunct reality show, Jim Bob and Michelle have welcomed 19 kids into this world.</p><p>They also briefly <a href=#>adopted a young relative of Michelle’s</a> when his mother was unable to care for him.</p><p>Needless to say, the Duggar compound was quite a full house at its peak!</p><p>We’re sure the need to feed so many mouths was one of the ways in which Jim Bob justified his relentless pursuit of wealth over the years.</p><p>Say what you will about his (largely unethical) methods, the man demonstrated quite a talent for making a buck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

worth?</h3><p><br>Jim Bob Duggar’s net worth is currently estimated at roughly $3.5 million.</p><p>Sources close to the former TLC star say that most of his cash comes from owning rental properties and flipping houses for a profit.</p><p>Of course, the start-up capital for his real estate concern came almost entirely from the money Jim Bob made during his years as a reality star.</p><p>As Jill’s memoir reminded us, Jim Bob didn’t give any of that cash to his kids, despite all of the work they put into making the family famous.</p><a href=#><img width=1336 height=946
