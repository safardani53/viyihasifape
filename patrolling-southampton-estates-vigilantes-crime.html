We’re not violent.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have to do this. It’s down to a lack of police resources.”</p><p>Torch in hand, Scott leads the group — a chatty middle-aged woman, a muscular lad in a baseball cap, a bearded man in his twenties and a young woman with a friendly Staffie cross.</p><p>The crew head through a rabbit warren of alleyways on a gritty estate on the fringes of Southampton.</p><p>They are among a 20-plus pool of volunteers which includes “former military, teachers, mums and elderly people”.</p><p>The members call themselves S019 Neighbourhood Watch after their Southampton suburb’s postcode. ­Others have called them vigilantes.</p><h2>A YOUTH IS PERCHED ON A SMASHED PHONE BOX</h2><p>Sholing and Bitterne — the neighbourhood patrolled by the group — saw 1,098 violent crimes and 385 cases of criminal damage and arson between June 2018 and July 2019.</p><p>Their Facebook page — liked by more than 3,000 people — says: “Getting annoyed with the youths of today thinking they can rob from hard-working people. Time to show some community spirit and catch the little salads (a local term for yobs).”</p><p>Scott — who patrols with “security” emblazoned on his back and a bike-locking chain strapped around his chest — insists: “A lot of people have said we’re vigilantes but we’re not.</p><p>“We’re there to observe and not get involved. Our protocol if we see something happening is to stand at a safe distance, get video footage, don’t get involved and call the police.”</p><p>The group was sparked into life around three weeks ago when there was an attempted break-in at an elderly woman’s home.</p><p>Former industrial cleaner Scott said: “Police didn’t want to know. They’re short-staffed.”</p><p>Earlier in the day I had seen a youth perched on top of a trashed phone box and smelt the whiff of cannabis near a fly-tipped bed.</p><p>But on this occasion, the time I spent patrolling with the group was mercifully free from crime or anti-social behaviour.</p><p>Volunteers split into teams to patrol the Thornhill, Sholing, Weston and Woolston areas of Southampton on foot or in cars every night.</p><p>The patrols offer an insight into a crime-plagued nation where the thin blue line has become thinner.</p><p>Since 2010, when there were just over 171,600 officers in the UK, police numbers have fallen annually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515489288.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515490213-e1566585887288.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515491419.jpg><p>By March this year there were just over 150,000 officers — a decrease of 12.4 per cent in nine years.</p><p>In Hampshire, where Southampton is the largest city, there were the equivalent of 2,835 full-time ­officers in March 2018 — a drop of 61 on 2017.</p><p>More than 600 police stations have closed across Britain in the past nine years. Cities the size of Bath and St Albans no longer have a dedicated cop shop.</p><p>In some towns, if you want to speak to an officer you have to call a freephone number.</p><p>Little wonder that recorded crime is at a 14-year high.</p><p>Last year violent offences soared by almost a fifth. Homicide rose to its highest level for nearly a decade.</p><p>But in the 12 months to March, just 7.8 per cent of recorded offences resulted in a criminal charge.</p><p>So it is hardly surprising unofficial citizen patrols have sprung up across Britain. In November The Sun visited ­Hartlepool. One Saturday, not a single officer was on duty in the town of 92,000, as all were on another job. A local group was set up to fill the gap.</p><p>Another team formed in Solihull, West Mids, where police credited them with forcing drug dealers away and reducing anti-social behaviour. ­Others patrol in Essex.</p><p>In Kidsgrove, Staffs, vigilantes &nbsp;threatened to use baseball bats to target thugs in a crime-ridden park.</p><p>Some cops have warned against the rise in have-a-go-hero groups.<br></p><h2>‘THEY BURNED TREE HOUSE AND SPRAYED PAINT’</h2><p>Last year Inspector Iftekhar Ahmed, of West Midlands police, said he was concerned they were “hindering the situation”.</p><p>But amid the tower blocks and ­pebble-dashed estates of SO19, the patrol group seems popular. Retired electrician David Elliot, 69, told how 30 thugs spilled out from a house party last week.</p><p>They smashed up his fence to use as weapons and were said to have assaulted a 17-year-old girl then threatened her dad with an air gun.</p><p>The dad of three said: “I was ­terrified. I’ve never known anything like it. It was drunken hooligans.”</p><p>He supports the patrols, adding: “The police should be doing it but they’ve had their numbers cut. We’re like a Third World country.”</p><p>Thornhill resident Gemma Rowe said her 11-year-old autistic son Jay, who also has ADHD, was devastated after three thugs stole his new £600 mountain bike three weeks ago — scuppering plans to take him on a family cycling trip.</p><p>The full-time carer said: “There’s no police in the area. No one was helping us until the patrol started.”</p><p>Mum-of-two Jo Lamb said Thornhill Adventure Park, where she took her kids to play, was destroyed by teenagers a couple of weeks ago. The 38-year-old care worker from Sholing said: “They burned the tree house and sprayed paint everywhere. The swings have been ripped out.</p><p>“Crime like this is driving people back inside their houses.”</p><p>Jo said Scott’s SO19 group is “already making a difference”.</p><p>She added: “The areas they patrol have seen much less crime.</p><p>“But it’s not stopping it. The kids doing it just move to other areas. It’s terrible they’ve had to set up a patrol. Nobody should have to put themselves in danger like that.</p><p>“People on the street could be carrying weapons. It should be up to the police instead.”</p><h2>THIN BLUE LINE AT 'BREAKING POINT'</h2><p>The SO19 group recently met Hampshire Constabulary.</p><p>The force’s Superintendent Kelly ­Whiting said: “We promote active citizenship. However, we do not condone vigilantism. We believe the group understand this.</p><p>“We explained we have to prioritise offences that cause most harm.”</p><p>Sergeant Zoe Wakefield, of the Hampshire Police Federation, said the thin blue line is “definitely at breaking point in some areas”.</p><p>She admitted that officers are sometimes made to work enforced overtime to make up the shortfall. And she revealed hard-stretched officers failed to respond when her husband’s bike was stolen recently.</p><p>Sgt Wakefield added: “We have to prioritise crimes. Some things have to drop down the list.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised last month to recruit more than 20,000 extra police ­officers within three years.</p><p>But cops point out the new ­officers will also need extra admin staff, equipment and vehicles.</p><p>Back in the dark alleyways of SO19, Scott welcomes the prospect of more cops — but until they appear he’ll be on the beat instead.</p><p>“We want more volunteers and more patrols,” he says.</p><p>“We just want people to feel safe on the streets and in their homes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515489305.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515489303.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515491503-e1566586176501.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Disturbing video shows vigilante gang batter 'burglar after catching him in neighbour's garden with crowbar'</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfboR5g5FxbWiokam%2FsLjLoqWgZaOkwrW0wKanraeeYrK0wMCtnKxlpp60qrjAp6ueq12Yv6q5xGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wayne-lineker-releases-statement-peter-crouch-chants.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wayne Lineker releases statement over 'disgusting' chants directed towards him at Peter Crouch's 'Cr">&larr;
