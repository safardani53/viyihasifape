Cameron McCarthy is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Fremantle Football Club in the AFL. With a cricket background, he turned to football and became a superb player.</p><p>Despite being the final player picked for Western Australia’s under-18 side in 2013, his ability in both sports pushed him to seek an AFL career.

Despite Fremantle’s continuous attempts throughout the trade season, McCarthy stayed with Greater Western Sydney.&nbsp;McCarthy elected to return to Western Australia due to homesickness and did not play the full 2016 AFL season.&nbsp;During the 2016 trade period, he was finally moved to Fremantle.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cam-McCarthy-2.jpg alt="Cam McCarthy" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>McCarthy shone out in a game against North Melbourne in 2019, scoring five goals and gathering 20 disposals.&nbsp;McCarthy and the club parted ways in August 2020 when Fremantle informed him that he would not be offered a contract for the 2021 AFL season.&nbsp;While specifics concerning Cam McCarthy’s AFL earnings and income are unknown, his achievements and accomplishments on the field have made an impression on the sport.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqVdorCkrdGtn7JlnprBbsPOq6uhZZikxG651JyfZpyfmsButMRmnJqqnmKubsXEmqlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-studded-ballet-flats-alaia-dupe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fashion fans race to ASOS to nab a 30 dupe of the viral 830 studded shoes causing a stir at Lond">&larr;
