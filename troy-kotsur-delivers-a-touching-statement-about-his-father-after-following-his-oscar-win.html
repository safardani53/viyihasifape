This year, eight of the 23 nominees were not announced live. They were recorded one hour before the ceremony and inserted at different times during the event. Troy Kotsur, the star of CODA, made history by being the second deaf actor to win an Academy Award and the first deaf man to do so. The actress, who has been deaf since birth, has received multiple prizes this season, including the Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as numerous distinctions at the BAFTAs and Critics’ Choice Awards.</p><p>A few prizes were given off-air as part of the Academy’s attempts to boost viewership for the 94th Academy Awards. Despite being Hollywood’s most prestigious awards event, it continues to elicit controversy year after year.&nbsp;The 93rd Academy Awards got the lowest ratings in the show’s history, despite having over 10 million viewers.</p><h2>Troy Kotsur delivers a heartfelt statement about his father After Following his Oscar triumph.</h2><p>The actor won an Oscar for his performance in the Apple TV+ drama CODA, after which he delivered a poignant acceptance speech to the audience in sign language, with presenter Youn Yuh-Jung standing right next to him.&nbsp;Troy Kotsur moved paid homage to his father, who is also deaf but unable to sign due to a vehicle accident that crippled him. He stated:</p><p>“Dad, you taught me so much. I’ll always have feelings for you. My idol is you. My father was our family’s finest vocalist. However, he was involved in an automobile accident and became paralyzed from the neck down.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Troy-Kotsur-2.jpg alt="Troy Kotsur" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As he collected his Oscar for his performance as fisherman Frank Rossi, the 53-year-old dedicated his medal to the deaf population, saying:</p><p>“This is devoted to the deaf, CODA, and handicapped communities. This is our chance!”</p><p>The celebrity expressed gratitude to the Academy members for the distinction, saying:</p><p>“It’s an honor to be a part of this adventure. I still can’t believe I’m here. Thank you very much to all of the Academy members for acknowledging my efforts.”</p><p>The Oscar winner praised the film’s remarkable reach and joked about teaching sign language to the White House.</p><p>“I was going to teach them nasty sign language, but [“CODA” co-star] Marlee Matlin advised me not to. So don’t be concerned, Marlee. I’m not going to use any f-bombs in my speech today.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Troy-Kotsur-3.jpg alt="Troy Kotsur" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>CODA, which stands for “child of deaf adults,” is a touching narrative of a high school girl who lives with her deaf mother, father, and brother. The film also stars Marlee Matlin, 56, who was the first member of the deaf community to be nominated for and subsequently won an Oscar in 1987 for her part in the film Children of a Lesser God.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actor</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Troy Kotsur</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirq6epYriwwNKuqWaclaG2t7HRrGSaZaSkwqS0yKeeZquklsGmucSnq2aZkqTCtXnHoqpmnpGptaa%2BjJqdrZ2iYrOwuMuorqKml2K1qr%2BMqKqcmaJixKq6jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-noivas-the-voice-savion-wright-5043138.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is NOIVAS (Savion Wright)?
