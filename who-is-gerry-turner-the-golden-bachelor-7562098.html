"100% confident. And I was also that confident that she was going to say 'yes' to me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the show aired, Turner — whose first name is pronounced GAIR-ee — said he was pushed to audition by his two daughters after their mother, Turner’s wife, died. Though the pressure could make any man nervous, he told GMA that being the first elderly man to lead the show “feels amazing and it's still sinking in.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the show's premiere in September 2023, Turner shared with PEOPLE that he was thrilled with how his first night went.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was literally like Christmas morning,” he said, referring to greeting all the women. “Every package [that] gets opened is better than the previous. At 7:30 the next morning, I was still wide awake and still wired that the producers told me and almost literally took me by the arm and said I had to leave. I can't tell you how much fun I had in those nine hours.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he was seemingly impressed with them all, he added that he made sure to keep his eye on the prize throughout the season as he looked for "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the one</a>." And he found her in Nist, whom he married in January 2024 during a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>live televised wedding special</a> on ABC.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“From the first sip of chocolate shake to the last taste of Costa Rican coffee, I learned that you are the woman I can't live without,"&nbsp;Turner said to Nist at the altar. "I learned that you make me calm, with the touch of your hand. I've learned that you make me laugh with the easy comfort of long-lost friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is the Golden Bachelor? Here’s everything to know about Gerry Turner, the latest addition to the growing Bachelor franchise.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-lives-in-indiana-but-plans-to-move-down-south></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He lives in Indiana but plans to move down south</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ABC/Brian Bowen Smith</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turner is from Indiana where he lives “in his dream house on a beautiful lake,” according to The Golden Bachelor’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>official synopsis</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Turner told PEOPLE that he and Nist, who is from New Jersey, plan to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>move south to Charleston, South Carolina</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“One of the things that I think fate played a hand in is the possibility of where we might wind up living,” Turner told PEOPLE. “For the last couple of years, when my family gets together, I've talked about moving to South Carolina, and it's an idea I've toyed with. And then in conversation with Theresa, a private moment, she's saying, ‘Well, yeah, my son lives near Charleston in South Carolina.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turner was concerned that whoever he ended up with might not be on the same page regarding where to live, but with Nist, it wasn't a problem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And all of a sudden it's like, there's a big problem that is gone,” Turner said. “The issue of compromising on where to live and how to reconcile families and all of that is, it's no longer an issue.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-was-excited-to-be-the-first-ever-golden-bachelor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He was excited to be the first-ever Golden Bachelor</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ABC/Brian Bowen Smith</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the first senior-aged man to lead the Bachelor spin-off show, Turner set the precedent for men dating in their 70s. But the pressure didn't get to him and he remained positive about his prospects, saying he “has nothing to lose.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In ABC’s promotional video for the show, the network teased some snippets of what audiences could expect with Turner as the lead.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He posts his thirst traps in a leather-bound album. His DMs have postage,” the teaser trailer revealed. ”He gets the early bird special any time he wants. If you call him, he’ll answer the phone. He doesn't have gray hair, he has 'wisdom highlights.' Florida wants to retire, and move to him. He’s Gerry.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his interview with PEOPLE, Turner shared that it didn't take too much convincing for him to sign up for the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When they sent me a text about it, I had seen the ads throughout the show. In the back of my mind, I thought, ‘That would be quite an experience. That would be a lot of fun,’ ” he said. “So when they really hit me up hard with it one night, they didn't have to push as hard as what they maybe thought. It was a back-and-forth in my head before I decided to actually fill out a questionnaire online, but I'm certainly glad I did.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-is-a-retired-restaurateur-with-many-hobbies></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He is a retired restaurateur with many hobbies</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ABC/Brian Bowen Smith</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before he started his journey as a reality TV star, Turner was a restaurateur, though he is now retired.

The two lived a “full and happy life” until Toni’s sudden death in 2017, six weeks after she retired and fell ill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She got robbed. Every day that goes by, that's the thought that I have," Turner told GMA. "I have her picture on a dresser in my closet. Every morning I give her a nod, 'So what do you think about this?' For awhile it was like, I was having a hard time figuring out if she would be okay. But we always told each other when one of us goes, we want the other to be happy. She's up there rooting [for me]. She's saying, 'Yeah, Gerry. Do this.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He told PEOPLE in September 2023 that after her death, he sold the lake house they planned on retiring in together and he sought grief counseling, which was "life-changing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“About three years in, I wasn't sure I was on track. I wasn't sure I was mending properly,” Turner admitted. “I remember having two sessions with the counselor, and he goes, ‘You're fine. You just got to give yourself credit for being OK.’ I changed my mind about counseling during that time. That is something I would recommend to anyone who's had loss, that just doesn't feel like they're getting over it quickly enough or in a healthy way.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-has-two-daughters-and-two-granddaughters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>He has two daughters and two granddaughters</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ABC/Brian Bowen Smith</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turner raised two daughters, Angie and Jenny, with his deceased wife.

He described the moment they saw Nist was the winner as "pretty magical."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Because of the way the sun was and the walk that Theresa had to do, she was a silhouette for an awfully long time.

Please let it be Theresa,’ ” Turner told PEOPLE. “And when the light hit enough so that they could see that it was her, they were ecstatic. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>They were in tears.
