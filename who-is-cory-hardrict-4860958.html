The actress and actor made headlines on Oct. 4 when it was revealed that the former filed for divorce, according to court documents obtained by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. She cited the reason for the filing as “irreconcilable differences” and took to Instagram to address the situation. “I have always been honest with my fans, and today is no different. I wanted to share that Cory and I have decided to go our separate ways,” she wrote in a caption of a black and white photo of the two of them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“These decisions are never easy, and not without sadness,” she continued. “We will maintain a friendship as we co-parent our beautiful children. I am grateful for all the happy times we had together and want to thank my friends, family and fans for your love and support as we start this new chapter moving forward in our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cory-Hardrict-5-Things-Tia-Mowry-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more about Cory and his history with Tia below.</p><h2>Cory’s an actor who has appeared in several television show and films.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cory-Hardrict-5-Things-Tia-Mowry-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Some of the most popular include Never Been Kissed, Crazy/Beautiful, The Oath, He’s Just Not That Into You, Brotherly Love, and The Outpost. He also appeared as a guest star on an episode of Tia’s sitcom, Sister, Sister back in 1996. His acting career started in the 1990s.</p><h2>He and Tia have two children together.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cory-Hardrict-5-Things-Tia-Mowry-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The former couple, who were married in 2008, welcomed son <strong>Cree Taylor</strong> in June 2011 and daughter <strong>Cairo Tiahna</strong> in May 2018. Both Tia and Cory have often shared adorable snapshots of their family on social media over the years and seem to have a very close bond with both of their kids.</p><h2>Cory met Tia on the set of a movie they worked on together.</h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I met my husband Cory on the set of a movie we were both filming called&nbsp;Hollywood Horror&nbsp;in 1999. It was the last year of&nbsp;Sister, Sister and I had decided to embark on my first feature film. I wasn’t really focused on boys at the time, since I was in my early 20s, juggling my career and going to school — however, while Cory and I were filming, he took a liking to me rather quickly,” Tia told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Cory also commented on their meeting and eventual romance, in an interview with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Essence</a> magazine. He explained that although his future wife-to-be had a successful acting career at the time, he was still working odd jobs to get by financially. “I had odd jobs. I worked at K-Mart, graveyard shift, security,” he said in the interview. “That’s when I was just grinding man. I met my wife during them days. She was with me. She was just coming out of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sister, Sister</a>, but they had everything man and I didn’t have anything. I had a studio apartment, sleeping in the corner, no furniture for almost two years.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He also mentioned how their relationship actually started. “I was waiting on a bus stop — after I shot my first film. Her sister and her drove by, they saw me waiting and asked to give me a ride,” he said. “I was embarrassed. I was downtown. They gave me a ride and we were friends ever since. They took me to Inglewood, so that’s how that relationship started.”</p><h2>He founded a production company.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>In Jan. 2022, it was announced that Cory was set to produce his first film, Conmen, under his Hardcor Films production company. <span>“Hardcor Films had been a mission of mine for many years,” he told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a> at the time. “I am excited to take the next step in my career, and I am blessed to collaborate with like-minded partners who want to make a cultural difference. The change will not come if we wait for someone else to give it to us.”</span></p><h2>Cory and Tia waited a year to have their first kiss.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The former lovebirds didn’t rush their romance and were good friends before they even took the next step. “I remember during one of our early dates, Cory had set up a picnic — he’s very romantic like that,” Tia told PEOPLE. “I had on these FUBU sneakers with an orange top and black Capri pants, and he had on an Allen Iverson jersey with a big fro. That was the day he had first asked to kiss me. It was all very sweet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KwsL7YZp%2BaqpSntqTAjG1vb2hpaoVw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mike-geiers-wife-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mike Geier Dating  Mike Geier's Wife &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
