As a result, “Hair growth products improve a person’s hair density, impacting hair that physically grows from the scalp, and reduce breakage to stop hair snapping at the ends,” says Philip Kingsley, a trichologist with over 60 years of experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But, here’s the thing: There are a lot of hair growth products out there that all claim to support growth in one form or another, so how do you know if they actually work? Through our own testing and extensive research, we found the best hair growth products that elongate the growth cycle, promote thicker strands, and provide deep hydration to prevent breakage. From serums and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shampoos for thinning hair</a> to an FDA-approved treatment plan, here are the best hair growth products.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thickening-serum-vegamour-gro-hair-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Thickening Serum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vegamour GRO Hair Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vegamour GRO Hair Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/S_mftThAp30qt9wrKccBEbqepUU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/VegamourGROHairSerum-1e5aaa6510dc4b70a29abe9df9149f6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Vegamour is one of our favorite haircare brands for supporting hair growth. But, while we love so many of their formulas, the GRO Hair Serum is a star formula for us. This thickening serum is formulated with impressive natural ingredients like curcumin stem cell extract (aka, turmeric), which has been studied for its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>hair loss prevention efforts</a> and is known to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>support hair growth</a>. The formula also contains red clover, which can keep hair thinning at bay, and mung bean which contains copper, a known supporter of hair health with the ability to prevent premature hair shedding. On top of these ingredients, the hair growth serum was clinically tested with results showing 52 percent more density and 76 percent less shedding, which is a major win for those looking to thicken up their strands. In addition to its performance, you can’t really beat the price, either, especially considering how effective it is for hair growth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 ounce | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Curcumin stem cell extract, red clover, mung bean</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-shampoo-and-conditioner-duo-virtue-flourish-shampoo-for-thinning-hair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Shampoo and Conditioner Duo</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Virtue Flourish Shampoo for Thinning Hair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Virtue Flourish Shampoo for Thinning Hair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3d7Cf0l2VxERpjXd-KTKhXU-ifk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Virtue-Flourish-Shampoo-for-Thinning-Hair-e1d833849ade43b6b9000f76155d5bc1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have thinning hair, the Virtue Flourish Shampoo and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Conditioner</a> for Thinning Hair is a must-have for your hair growth arsenal. The shampoo is formulated to clean debris from follicle openings and is formulated with alpha and gamma keratin proteins, which support hair density, as well as natural humectants to provide the scalp and strands with deep and lasting nourishment. Similarly, the conditioner is also formulated with keratin proteins, but with the support of green tea extract and probiotics, which can leave hair looking shinier and help prevent breakage (which, in addition to hair loss, can contribute to thinning hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 ounces (shampoo), 6.7 ounces (conditioner) | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Alpha and gamma keratin proteins, green tea, and probiotics</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-mask-bondiboost-miracle-mask-for-thinning-hair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hair Mask</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BondiBoost Miracle Mask for Thinning Hair</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BondiBoost Miracle Mask for Thinning Hair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/qKLaTmCvX28xKwwsfQn1sSKtha8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BondiBoost-Miracle-Mask-for-Thinning-Hair-eca7bd202340411ea0549d05f6381733.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The BondiBoost Miracle Mask for Thinning Hair might not promote hair growth, per se, but it does a fabulous job of thickening and improving overall hair density. This coveted hair mask is supported by key ingredients like patented Procaphil and Redensyl, making it a good choice not only for thinning hair but also for hair aging, since Procapil specifically addresses hair aging, especially hair loss related to aging, and Redensyl helps target hair loss, too. In addition to these, the hair mask also includes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>argan oil</a>, which haircare experts swear by for its impressive nourishing abilities, thanks to its fatty acid and antioxidants, which provide lasting shine, hydration, and softness to strands.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.45 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Procapil, argan oil, redensyl</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-scalp-massager-heeta-hair-brush-scalp-massager></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Scalp Massager</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Heeta Hair Brush Scalp Massager</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon heeta-hair-scalp-brush-and-massager" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vJzP6pyOn3rz9HzFLJ5HiHeXK78=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/heeta-hair-scalp-brush-and-massager-d24ad1e89649480dab0890596faa216f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A scalp massager not only feels amazing but also helps stimulate the hair follicles, which could support hair growth efforts. If you’re on the hunt for the best one, we recommend going with something that multi-tasks, such as the HEETA Shampoo Brush Scalp Massager. This brush is created with soft silicone bristles designed to help apply an even shampoo application while exfoliating, soothing, and stimulating the scalp. With rave reviews from over 133,000 Amazon customers, the brush is most beloved for how well it cleans the scalp, the relaxing massage sensation it provides, and the ergonomic design, which makes it easy to use and comfortable to hold.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Good for: </strong>Exfoliation, scalp soothing, and shampoo application | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, green, purple, rose pink, rose red, sea blue, sky blue, sky gray, turquoise and black, yellow&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thinning-hair-dr-barbara-sturm-anti-hair-fall-scalp-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best For Thinning Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Barbara Sturm Anti-Hair Fall Scalp Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Barbara Sturm Anti- Hair Fall Scalp Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zSeX-xUUf2zCUxCovoZaqqpOE3E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-barbara-sturm-anti--hair-fall-scalp-serum-7dc7c16abe30498cb3e3c2ce51f553ce.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those who experience hair thinning can turn to the Dr. Barbara Turm Anti-Hair Fall Scalp Serum, which is specifically formulated as a gentle treatment for targeting hair loss and promoting an all-around healthier scalp. The formula, which contains ingredients such as camellia and larch extracts for hair follicle nourishment, as well as pro-vitamin B5 for hydration, received a near-perfect score from customers who swear by it for its ability to thicken, soothe the scalp, and provide a nice shiny finish to the strands. In addition to its hair growth benefits, the scalp serum is also a go-to for protecting the scalp and strands against environmental aggressors such as pollution, heat, and UV damage, which can cause stress and impact the overall health of the hair and scalp.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.6 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Camellia, sunflower sprouts, tara and larch extracts, pro-vitamin B5, hyaluronic acid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hair-growth-serum-act-acre-stem-cell-scalp-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hair Growth Serum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Act+ Acre Stem Cell Scalp Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Act+ Acre Stem Cell Scalp Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e4RBXHswiICBbw_FFwn4SN4-qpc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Act-Acre-Stem-Cell-Scalp-Serum-54aa93dcf206484c98a9a81fc93d0b8a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Act+ Acre</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Act + Acre Stem Cell Scalp Serum is our top pick for the best hair growth serum because, with regular use (and over a period of time), it can not only make a difference in hair growth but also help support hair health and even target some of the common signs of aging in hair. The serum is enriched with Swiss apple stem cells which have been clinically studied and have shown to reduce shedding by 34 percent as well as elongate the hair growth phase, leading to longer and healthier hair. The formula is also supported by aloe vera and bamboo extracts to help maintain hydration so that strands look and feel silky, soft, and smooth with every use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With all of this in mind, this serum is a leave-in product, and if you don’t wash your hair at least once a week (and maybe even more than that, depending on your hair type), you might find that the hair feels a bit greasy at the roots. Some customers with elongated hair wash regimens also note their scalps felt itchy if they didn’t rinse and repeat more regularly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.2 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Swiss apple stem cells, aloe vera, bamboo extracts</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-buildup-busting-formula-jupiter-the-buildup-breakdown-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Buildup-Busting Formula</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jupiter The “Buildup Breakdown” Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jupiter The &amp;acirc;Buildup Breakdown&amp;acirc; Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/TjnYPnBW8DqiWPsMHQQ6VgF9ygo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jupiter-The-Buildup-Breakdown-Set-e55bb6fff8594e34ac074d234c7254e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jupiter</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to treating your complexion to a purifying charcoal mask, a clarifying hair mask can provide a detoxifying cleanse and help set your scalp up for hair growth success. Our top pick for this category is the Jupiter Buildup Breakdown Set, which includes a pre-wash mask and a scalp exfoliating brush for application (which you can then use when applying shampoo). The formula is rich with hair growth and scalp health-supporting ingredients, including argan oil which nourishes, biotin for promoting hair thickness, panthenol to prevent moisture loss, and volcanic ash, which exfoliates and absorbs oil build-up for a more clarified scalp surface. We love this mask because it does an excellent job of refreshing our roots, and it’s also incredibly easy to use, as it goes on kind of like a shampoo and then rinses out with ease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Argan oil, biotin, pantheon, volcanic ash&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brow-growth-serum-revitalash-revitabrow-advanced-eyebrow-conditioner-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Brow Growth Serum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RevitaLash RevitaBrow Conditioner Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RevitaLash RevitaBrow Advanced Eyebrow Conditioner Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/u0MOvQPmo5f9Twr6_qjmmcV-i6U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revitalash-revitabrow-advanced-eyebrow-conditioner-serum-3c3858b4f62547efb5882cfd0819e80e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The hair on your head isn’t the only thing that can benefit from hair growth products. For those looking for a product that can support eyebrow growth and thickening, we recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>RevitaLash RevitaBrow Advanced Eyebrow Conditioner Serum</a>. Comparable to the brand’s coveted lash serums, this brow growth serum contains key ingredient BioPeptin Complex, which is a combination of lipids, peptides, biotin, and green tea extract designed to condition teeny tiny eyebrow hairs and support growth. In addition to its function, what makes this product stand out, even more, is the fact that it is safe to use on tinted brows, as well as permanent or semi-permanent makeup (think: microblading), so you can style your brows and grow them out, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.10 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>BioPeptin Complex</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-postpartum-hair-loss-liaison-hair-bond></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Postpartum Hair Loss</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Liaison Hair Bond</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Liaison Hair Bond" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KY6R8TMI4qm8qOkSpUwURFOk1iY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Liaison-Hair-Bond-063e49777c0a4983a36ae6c132b64191.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Liaison</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Postpartum hair loss can be frustrating to manage, however, the Liason Hair Bond formula makes it a bit easier to manage by promoting hair regrowth. With a blend of potent active ingredients, such as ginseng extract, vitamin B6, biotin, citric acid, and ginger (to name a few), this scalp serum works to rebuild hair fibers and stimulate the hair follicles so that hair not only grows back, but comes back thicker and revitalized. The formula works by boosting circulation on the scalp, stimulating the hair growth stage, and providing a clean and ideal climate for hair regrowth. And, while it focuses on new growth, it also supports the health of pre-existing strands, helping to nourish, protect, and even thicken them up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.6 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Citric acid, propylene glycol, oriental arborvitae leaf extract, ginseng extract, Angelica extract, polygonum multiflorum extract, zingiber officinalel, vitamin B6, biotin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lash-growth-serum-maybelline-lash-sensational-boosting-eyelash-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lash Growth Serum</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maybelline Boosting Eyelash Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Maybelline Lash Sensational Boosting Eyelash Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/P_RhU1vJ2pL9UPg_1LiodWSkeSs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/maybelline-lash-sensational-serum-d35b321be97f41bdbbc7b2c5a669a2fc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on an effective lash serum.

The Maybelline Lash Sensational Boosting Eyelash Serum comes highly recommended by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok influencers</a> and drugstore beauty lovers alike for its cheap price yet luxe-acting formula. This is largely due to the impressive ingredients, which include arginine and pro-vitamin B5, two ingredients that promote ultra-healthy lashes that are plush, shiny, and more full-looking. With high ratings from thousands of Amazon customers, shoppers say the drugstore lash growth serum is even comparable to more luxe counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.74 ounces | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Arginine, pro-vitamin B5&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-treatment-plan-keeps-treatment-plan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Treatment Plan</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Keeps Treatment Plan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Keeps Treatment Plan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KzO2H0DarpwWjsN01zZ3zDQ5On8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Keeps-Treatment-Plan-fe5c2a9b2126434e95a478a58d1c6c48.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Keeps</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you experience a receding hairline or thinning at the crown and are considering taking drastic action with a hair loss prescription, Keeps makes everything much easier (and more affordable, too). Designed as a hair loss solution for men, the company has three different treatment plans based on specific hair loss concerns and either include the medications Minoxidil, Finasteride, or a combination of both. We love the Keeps treatment plans because they are FDA-approved and make medical solutions for hair loss much more accessible, in terms of convenience and price. On top of that, the company offers free consultations with medical professionals so you can share more about your hair loss experience and find out exactly which plan is right for your needs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>Varies based on plan | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Minoxidil, Finasteride&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-system-divi-the-starter-bundle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best System</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Divi The Starter Bundle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Divi The Starter Bundle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/sLSqzae6ISJ2_ztmpX6ejI2vbMM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Divi-The-Starter-Bundle-aa099e0b597642fcba445d80cde42439.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Divi</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Divi Scalp Serum is without a doubt one of the best hair growth products on the market, thanks to its potent formula of Copper Tripeptide-1 (known for extending the growth phase), caffeine, tea tree oil, and amino acids to support thickening and growth efforts as well as overall hair and scalp health. If you’re looking for a hair growth system, we recommend investing in the brand’s Starter Bundle, which includes a bottle of the coveted serum as well as the revitalizing shampoo and conditioner duo that is equally as impressive and can create the best (read: clean and nourished) climate for the promotion of hair growth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have tried all three hair growth products and love the way they invigorate the scalp and how they leave hair feeling ultra-shiny and soft.

No matter what hair care product you use, take a look at the back of the bottle or ingredients list on the retailer's product page and review the ingredients featured. It’s best to use formulas that incorporate ingredients clinically proven to provide hair growth benefits. Dr. Peter Young, M.D., a medical director at Keeps, says to look for plant-based, organic, and science-backed ingredients like biotin, caffeine, and green tea, which “support hair growth and give the appearance of thicker, healthier-looking hair.” Nourishing and hydrating ingredients like antioxidant-rich argan oil and hyaluronic acid are also noteworthy as these can give hair a hydration boost which — like skincare — is essential for optimal scalp and hair health.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to haircare ingredients, Dr. Young says hair growth medications are also worth considering (though it is recommended that you consult a professional first). “Minoxidil is an over-the-counter medication that comes in liquid or foam form and is available at two strengths,” he notes. While the medication can take at least three to four months for results to show, the medication is a known and proven solution for hair loss. “Minoxidil helps to shorten the telogen phase of the hair cycle (the shedding phase, which results in excessive daily hair fall) which becomes longer in male or female pattern hair loss and prolongs the time follicles spend actively growing,” Kinglsey adds, noting that it’s the only FDA-approved topical medication for hair growth at the moment.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Scalp Serum</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for hair growth products, Kingsley says to consider investing in a scalp serum “to maintain [an] optimal scalp environment, stimulate follicle health, and reduce hair shedding.” Scalp serums come in a variety of formulas and the ones designed for hair growth can sometimes lead to longer hair, but can also target other concerns like hair density, breakage, and overall health.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a scalp serum designed to trigger hair growth, consider the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Act + Acre Stem Cell Scalp Serum</a>, which is formulated with active ingredients that have been clinically studied to elongate the hair growth phase as well as reduce shedding.

With this in mind, hydrating ingredients and formulas can put the stretch and elasticity back into strands and result in stronger, less breakage-prone hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-59f0dda0-bab3-4922-9d21-c9745b4706f3></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.75780409042><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Do hair growth products actually work?</span></p><p>“It widely varies on the formulation, product type, and brand,” says Kingsley. When in doubt, he recommends looking at ingredients and formulas that undergo clinical trials with proven results. And, if you experience excessive hair loss, it’s recommended to seek the advice of a professional, who can provide further insight on the cause of your hair loss and might prescribe additional measures such as Minoxidil.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can thinning hair grow back?</span></p><p>While hair thinning might feel alarming, experts assure that thinning hair can grow back, especially when taking good care of your hair with clinically-proven ingredients and formulas and, in more severe cases, using over-the-counter medications such as Minoxidil. With that said, Dr. Young says it’s also important to address health habits that can compound the issue of thinning hair.&nbsp;</p><p>“Taking care of yourself with a healthy, well-balanced diet, getting plenty of sleep, and eliminating stressors in your life will help maintain proper functions of your body, including hair growth,” he explains. He recommends consulting with your healthcare provider, who might order a blood test to check for vitamin and nutrient levels: “Taking certain vitamins could curb that extra hair shedding if your levels are low.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98351648351648><p><span class=accordion__title>What oil is best for hair growth?</span></p><p>According to Dr. Young, there is not just one oil that is best for hair growth — there are several. “There is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>one study</a> that shows that coconut oil assisted with decreasing how much protein the hair lost, which basically means it prevented the hair from getting weaker,” he notes.
