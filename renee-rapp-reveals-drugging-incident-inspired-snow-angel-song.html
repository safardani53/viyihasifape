Fresh off a breakup in early 2022, Rapp said she began hanging out with a new group of cohorts.</p><p>“I had always had to, like, really nail myself to the ground, and I had always been just so incredibly nervous, and for the first time, I just didn’t,” she explained to host <a href=#><strong>Jay Shetty</strong></a>. “And I really let my judgment go when it came to the people that were around me.”</p><p>Following multiple situations where the group proved to be “not trustworthy,” Rapp said she found herself “face-up, laying down in a bathroom stall in a hotel bar, just waking up at, like, 5 in the morning, completely alone.”</p><p>She continued: “I still have no idea what happened, no clue what happened, but I was drugged and just, like, missing for seven hours. And I stopped being friends with those people and stopped doing as much partying as I was and told my parents, told some of my friends, and just kind of explained it in a really matter-of-fact way. And they were all very concerned, and I didn’t even really understand what was happening, because again, I didn’t recall anything that had happened.”</p><p>It wasn’t until a few months after the incident that Rapp said she began to “deal” with the aftermath of it, noting, “[I] was just crying and so upset and very confused, and then resentful ‘cause it was friends that I was with.”</p><p>Rapp — who announced in June that <a href=#>she would be leaving</a> Max’s <a href=#>The Sex Lives of College Girls</a> during season 3 — felt inspired to write a song about the experience with producer <strong>Alexander 23</strong> for her first full-length album, which was released on August 18.</p><p>“The whole time we were writing it, I felt nothing. Nothing,” she noted on the podcast. “I was explaining all this stuff, and I was like, ‘Yeah, and you can reference the snow as whatever you want to reference it as,’ and things like that, and I felt nothing at all until we had recorded the song, the whole thing was done and I played it for a bunch of my friends and my manager. And everybody was like, ‘This is insane.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Renee-Rapp-Feels-Resilient-Following-Traumatic-Incident-That-Inspired-Song-Snow-Angel-331.jpg><p>The lyrics of “Snow Angel” seemingly detail her journey of overcoming trauma, as she sings, “I’ll make it through the winter if it kills me / I can make it faster if I hurry / I’ll angel in the snow until I’m worthy / But if it kills me, I tried.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Mean Girls the Musical</a> star called 2022 her year of “inherent resilience,” as she told Shetty, 35. “Not only was I fighting through an experience I have no idea what happened to me, lost friends, felt like I couldn’t go out with anybody and trust anybody … but [I] was also afraid to be judged to have something like that happen to me but it’s also like, ‘What did happen?’ So, it was a whole thing up until we decided to name the album Snow Angel and have that be the song, that to me was all resilience.”</p><p>At the end of the day, Rapp said she still “doesn’t really know how to feel about it,” but she does “feel weird and resilient.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmeppWaerOtz6lkq52mmq6tv4ydqa6fl567qHnIp5qinJWjwW61zaynoqqVmXq0us6wZJqml5q5br%2FOp55o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shaquille-oneal-bets-charles-barkley-10k-to-spell-spectacular-on-camera.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shaquille O'Neal Bets Charles Barkley $10K to Spell 'Spectacular'">&larr;
