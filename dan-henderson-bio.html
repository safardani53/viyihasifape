Also, the former UFC fighter is a two-time Olympian with his country, the United States of America.</p><p>All in all, the California native is one of the most decorated athletes, let alone fighters in the whole world. As a result, he is also one of the most well-known and respected fighters out there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/dan.jpg><p>However, Henderson did not achieve all of his success in one day. Instead, it took him nearly two decades to cement his legacy as one of the best.</p><p>This article will guide you through his early MMA career to his rise in fame with Pride FC and then to his eventual retirement with the UFC. Besides, you will also find information regarding Dan’s net worth, fight purse, achievements, and family.</p><p>But first, just like MMA fighters, warm up before their fight, let’s warm up with some quick facts before we get on to the serious stuff.</p><h2>Quick Facts about Dan Henderson</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody readability=9.5232558139535><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Daniel Jeffery Henderson</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>24 August 1970</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Downey, California, U.S.A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Hendo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Bill Henderson</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Tom Henderson, Selanee Henderson</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>53 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5’11″ (1.80 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>84 kg (185 lb)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Zodiac Sign</strong></td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$8 million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Division</strong></td><td>Middleweight, Light-Heavyweight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Rachel Malter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>Sierra Henderson, Reese Henderson</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Mixed Martial Arts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Reach</strong></td><td>&nbsp;74 inch ( 188cm)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Style</strong></td><td>Wrestling</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Team</strong></td><td>Team Quest (1999-present), Dan Henderson Fitness Center</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fighting out of</strong></td><td>Temecula, California</td></tr><tr><td><strong>MMA Record</strong></td><td>32-15-0</td></tr><tr readability=1.6585365853659><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><span class=dataValue><a href=#>Instagram</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a>, <a href=#>Facebook</a></span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Autographed Items</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>December, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Dan Henderson | Career & Records</h2><p>Long before Henderson rose to prominence with Pride FC as their two-division world champion, the former olympian followed his longtime friend and another future UFC</p><p>Legend, <strong>Randy Couture</strong>, into MMA. At first, Dan saw MMA as a means to increase his income to fund his dream of making it into the Olympics team for the third time.</p><p>To illustrate, at UFC 204 in his last fight, Henderson said,</p><h4>“When I first started fighting, it was more to make a little money to keep wrestling and it turned into loving the sport. My main goals were set in wrestling and I had zero goals in MMA.”</h4><p>Returning to the subject, the two-time Olympian made his professional debut in MMA in the 1997 Brazil Open Tournament. Subsequently, in a trailer of what was to come in the future, Henderson won the Championship after two relatively quick finishes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henderson-216.jpg><p>Following a year’s sabbatical from the sport, Dan returned to MMA, this time with the UFC. However, at that time, UFC was not as humongous and well-known as it is now.</p><p>Nevertheless, the California native won his second consecutive tournament despite a broken jaw due to a punch delivered from future Welterweight champion <strong>Carlos Newton</strong>.</p><p>But, by this time, the two-time Olympian had still not decided to make MMA his primary focus.</p><p>Instead, the decision was made for Henderson as he failed to qualify for the 2000 Olympics team along with coming up short at the World Team Trial in 2001.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Benavidez Bio: Career, Net Worth, Height, Wife, Salary Wiki >></a></strong></h4><h3>More</h3><p>It was at this moment that Dan decided to make Mixed Martial Arts his profession. As they say, the rest is history because, at the time of writing, Henderson is probably the most decorated mixed martial artist ever to grace the sport.</p><p>To resume, the two-time Olympian won his third consecutive tournament at Rings: Kings of Kings. What’s even more astounding is that there was no weight limit for the tourney.</p><p>As a result, Henderson had to face opponents that were 30 pounds heavier than him routinely.</p><p>Following his impressive performances throughout the previous years, Pride FC snapped up Dan before any other competitors could. Only a few could have imagined the impact that Henderson would have on the Pride FC organization as a whole and vice-versa.</p><p>To illustrate, the California native won the Pride Middleweight Championship by defeating <strong>Wanderlei Silva</strong> at Pride 33 while still holding the Welterweight Championship.</p><p>Consequently, Dan became the first fighter to hold two titles in two different weight divisions simultaneously in a major MMA organization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henderson-217.jpg><p>To further highlight the two-time Olympian’s achievement with the Pride FC banner, <a href=#>Conor Mcgregor</a> became the only fighter after Henderson to hold two different weight division belts simultaneously in a major MMA organization in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, it took nearly 10 years for any fighter to replicate what the 49-year-old had done in 2006.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stipe Miocic Bio: Career, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><h3>More</h3><p>As a result, UFC swooped in and signed the California native as he was the most popular and talented fighter outside of the company.</p><p>Subsequently, in Henderson’s first fight after returning to the UFC, Dan faced Light Heavyweight Champion&nbsp;<strong>Quinton</strong> <strong>“</strong><strong>Rampage” Jackson,</strong> and Middleweight Champion, <strong>Anderson Silva.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In both those fights, the two-time Olympian showcased his champion’s mentality and quality. But, unfortunately, Dan lost both those bouts.</p><p>In contrast, Henderson bounced back from his inauspicious start with the UFC and won his next three bouts against <strong>Rousimar Palhares</strong>, <strong>Rich Franklin</strong>, and <strong>Michael Bisping</strong>.</p><p>As a result, many fans and fighters thought Dan had earned another opportunity at the Middleweight Championship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henderson-213.jpg><p>In an unexpected turn of circumstances, the California native decided to sign for UFC’s competitor Strikeforce instead due to his contract expiration.</p><p>Subsequently, although losing his first fight with Strikeforce, Henderson went on a winning spree, which included him winning the Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Championship. Also, Dan secured a knockout victory against MMA legend, <strong>Fedor Emelianenko</strong> in his last fight with the organization.</p><p>People say that “If two individuals are meant to be with each other, then nothing can stop them.” And this was the case with Henderson and the UFC as the former Pride Welterweight Champion signed with the organization mentioned above.</p><p>Subsequently, Dan embarked on his third and final UFC run, which would also turn out to be his longest. However, by this time, Henderson was already 38 years old.</p><h3>And More</h3><p>As a result, the California native’s body and reflexes were not the same as during his early years. Contrarily, Dan still possessed the one-punch knockout ability that made him such a feared opposition.</p><p>In his third run with the UFC, the two-time Olympian appeared 11 times, winning four and losing seven bouts. The primary reason for Dan’s bad record is his slow reflexes due to his age.</p><p>However, Henderson’s fights to win were all via knockouts, which further highlights his punching power.</p><p>In his last ever fight in MMA, the California native managed to take UFC Middleweight Champion, Michael Bisping, to the final buzzer as the fight had to be decided by the judges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henderson-214.jpg><p>Even though Henderson lost the fight, it was not without some flashes of his past form as he knocked down Bisping twice over the course of the five rounds. Ultimately, Michael proved too durable for Dan as he closed out the fourth and fifth rounds firmly to secure a unanimous victory.</p><p>To conclude, Dan Henderson is probably the most versatile MMA fighter to have ever lived, as suggested by his Championships in various organizations and different weight classes.</p><p>As a result, Henderson was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame on 5 July 2018 for his outstanding contributions to the MMA scene as a whole.</p><h2>Dan Henderson | Awards and Accomplishments</h2><h3>Mixed Martial Arts</h3><table><tbody readability=8><tr readability=2><td width=319>1997</td><td width=319>Brazil Open Tournament Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1998</td><td width=319>UFC 17 Middleweight Tournament Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2000</td><td width=319>RINGS King of Kings Absolute Tournament Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2005</td><td width=319>Pride FC Bushido Welterweight Grand Prix Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2005</td><td width=319>Pride FC Welterweight Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2007</td><td width=319>Pride FC Welterweight Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2009</td><td width=319>Pride FC Welterweight Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2011</td><td width=319>Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Champion</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here’s a video of Dan Henderson and Daniel Cormier, fighting against each other:</p><p></p><h3>Amateur Wrestling</h3><table><tbody readability=24><tr readability=2><td width=319>1993</td><td width=319>&nbsp;US Open Senior National Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1993</td><td width=319>USA University Greco Roman National Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1993</td><td width=319>NCAA Qualifier (Arizona State University)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td width=319>1992</td><td width=319>US Olympian, Greco Roman (10th)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1991</td><td width=319>USA University Greco Roman National Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1990</td><td width=319>FILA Junior World Greco Roman Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1990</td><td width=319>Amateur Wrestling News Freshman All American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1988</td><td width=319>USA Junior National Freestyle and Greco Roman Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1988</td><td width=319>California State Junior Freestyle Champion</td></tr><tr readability=3><td width=319>1988</td><td width=319>California Interscholastic Federation Championships, 5th</td></tr><tr readability=3><td width=319>1987</td><td width=319>California Interscholastic Federation Championships, 2nd</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1998</td><td width=319>&nbsp;Pan American Games bronze medalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1997</td><td width=319>US World Team member (7th)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1997</td><td width=319>US Open Senior National Champion</td></tr><tr readability=3><td width=319>1996</td><td width=319>US Olympian, Greco Roman (12th)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1996</td><td width=319>World Cup silver medalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1995</td><td width=319>Pan American Games bronze medalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1994</td><td width=319>US World Team member (12th) & 1997 (7th)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1994</td><td width=319>US Open Senior National Champion</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1994</td><td width=319>World Cup silver medalist</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>1994</td><td width=319>USA University Greco Roman National Champion mma champ temecula fitness</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=319>2000</td><td width=319>Pan American Games Champion</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>How old is Dan Henderson? | Height & Body</h2><h2>Measurements</h2><p>As of now, Henderson is 49 years old, with his birthday falling on the 24th of August. Furthermore, Dan retired from the MMA scene at the age of 45, reflecting the former UFC Middleweight champion’s quality and fitness. For instance, the California native fought for the UFC Middleweight Championship in his last fight against Michael Bisping.</p><h3>How tall is Dan Henderson?</h3><p>Even though Dan might look quite small on TV, Henderson stands at 5 feet 11 inches in reality. Some might say that the former Olympian is quite small for his division.</p><p>On the contrary, Dan has answered every question put forth by his opponents, whether big or small, short or tall, as suggested by his impressive haul of achievements.</p><p><strong><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>If you are interested in buying boxing shorts, click here>></a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/henderson-215.jpg><p>To illustrate, the 49-year-old has won the Pride Middleweight and Welterweight Championship&nbsp;and Strikeforce Light-Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>In conclusion, during his peak years, the California native could not only fight in several divisions against much bigger opponents but could also knock them out cold with his unbelievable punch knock-out power.</p><h2>What is Dan Henderson’s Net Worth? | Fight Purse</h2><p>At the time of writing, Henderson is worth <strong>$8 million</strong>, massive for an MMA fighter. Furthermore, during his time with the UFC, Dan was one of the most well-paid fighters.</p><p>It is mainly because the former UFC middleweight champion was also one of the best fighters fighting in several divisions.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reece James Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Net Worth, Family Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>For instance, the 49-year-old received over <strong>$1.54 million</strong> for his last two fights with the UFC.</p><p>First of all, at UFC 199, Henderson earned a staggering <strong>$860,000</strong> which included <strong>$600,000</strong> to show, <strong>$200,000</strong> win bonus, <strong>$50,000</strong> Performance of the Night bonus, <strong>$30,000</strong> Reebok sponsorship.</p><p>Secondly, the former Olympian received a total of <strong>$680,000</strong> for his last fight for the UFC at UFC 204 in a Middleweight title fight against Michael Bisping. Similarly, Dan has earned a lot of money fighting for various MMA organizations contributing to the 49-year-old’s massive net worth.</p><h2>Dan Henderson | Wife & Family</h2><p>Henderson was born to his father, <strong>Bill Henderson</strong>, and his mother, who remains unknown.

To illustrate, Henderson likes to spend most of his time with his four children and wife, as seen through various social media handles.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodrygo Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Position, Age, Family Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Contrarily, the 49-year-old was married before to <strong>Allison Henderson</strong>. But due to various unforeseen circumstances, the former couple got divorced with mutual consent. But, that was in the past, and therefore it should be left in the past.</p><p>As of now, Dan and Rachel are in a healthy six-year-long relationship with both of them, pleased and satisfied. So, it is safe to say that this will be the last time Henderson marries.</p><h2>Dan Henderson | Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: 336,000 followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>: 511,000 followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>: 630,000 followers</p><h2>Common Queries about Dan Henderson</h2><h3>What did Dan Henderson say about Michael Bisping? / What is the Dan Henderson – Michael Bisping issue?</h3><p>Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping first became rivals when they appeared as opposite team coaches on the Ultimate Fighter.
