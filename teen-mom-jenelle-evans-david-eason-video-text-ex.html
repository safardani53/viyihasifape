You are worth so much more."</p><p>As a fourth cried out: "Youâ€™ll never change. You deserve each other."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>BREAKING DOWN</h2><p>Just a few hours earlier, Jenelle <a href=#>broke down in tears</a> on the same platform while <a aria-label="discussing betrayal (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">discussing betrayal</a>.</p><p>Jace was recently found after he ran away from home. Shortly fter that, the teen accused his step-father of attacking him.</p><p>David was subsequently&nbsp;<a href=#>charged with child abuse</a>.</p><p>That and the flirtatious text messages sent to his ex sent Jenelle into a tailspin.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>unfollowed each other</a>&nbsp;on Instagram and Jenelle <a href=#>deleted all of her TikToks with David</a>.</p><p>In the new&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>, Jenelle said she couldn't sleep and woke up at 3.22 in the morning "out of a dead sleep."</p><p>After saying she just started crying, she admitted:&nbsp;"I think I'm completely grieving right now and, um, it sucks."</p><p>She said that she was feeling betrayed by "every person" in her life, adding that life kept hitting her with "these bowling balls."</p><p>Jenelle continued: "It's really hard to deal with all the emotions and I'm just trying to do my best.</p><p>"I keep telling myself, 'You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine,' but then I have these outbursts of just crying, just out of nowhere."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>TROUBLING TEXTS</h2><p>In <a href=#>text messages obtained by the U.S. Sun</a> and verified to have come from David's cell phone to Whitney on her birthday in May of last year- he told his ex:&nbsp;</p><p>"You were perfect. You just deserve so much better than everything you've been through. That's why it makes me so sad. I think about it so much."</p><p>"And I dream about you all the time. I don't know how I ended up here instead of where I wanted to be. I don't know how WE ended up here instead of where I wanted US to be."</p><p>David then added: "I'm just so upset right now. And I wish I could turn back the clock."</p><p>Whitney exclusively told The U.S. Sun that she was "very shocked and surprised," when&nbsp;Jenelle's husband texted her.</p><p>Whitney, 35, said outside of this exchange, she and David "had hardly communicated at all because Maryssa had a phone since she was eight years old.&nbsp;</p><p>"So all my communication was through her other than maybe a handful of times."</p><p>"It was very surprising not to mention the fact that he was married, still married. I was married, still married.</p><p>"It was inappropriate and very unexpected."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PROTECTIVE SERVICES</h2><p>This development comes after Child Protective Services has once again become involved with Jenelle and David's home life.</p><p>Jenelle's eldest child&nbsp;<a href=#>Jace was placed in CPS custody</a>&nbsp;in late September, just months after the MTV star got custody of the teen in March from her mother Barbara, who had taken care of Jace since he was a toddler.</p><p>Despite being mired in investigations from CPS and the Columbus County Sheriff's Department after allegations that David assaulted Jace, Jenelle took to her social media accounts to promote new content for her OnlyFans page.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, a law enforcement source told The U.S. Sun that there is officially a criminal investigation into&nbsp;Jenelle&nbsp;and&nbsp;David&nbsp;after allegations he assaulted the star's&nbsp;son Jace&nbsp;late last month.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Multiple sources have previously claimed that both CPS and the Columbus County Sheriff's Department were involved in the investigation which was launched following&nbsp;<a href=#>Jace's third runaway attempt</a>.</p><p>It is unclear exactly what charges David might face, and it's unclear if Jenelle will face any charges relating to the alleged attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/www-tiktok-com-jenellelevans-video-856770159.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/jenelle-evans-says-taking-kids-853188663.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/whitney-rich-husband-shane-teen-854603189-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZWZ%2BeoSPaKuenZ5iurC5jKOcp52cobJusdWapaxllJbDqrCMnpisp55iw6qwxKhkrZ2oqXqmxI4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-stacey-dash-kids-lola-lovell-austin-williams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are Stacey Dash's kids?">&larr;
