Emma entered the ring after the slap and dealt with the Zelina Vega problem.</p><p>Moving on, while WWE’s policy of prohibiting its superstars from using third-party platforms such as Cameo and Twitch affected the streamers like Zelina, who ran a Twitch account along with her husband Aleister Black, she found a way around the company’s third-party mandate with OnlyFans.</p><p>Initially, WWE’s third-party mandate did not extend to OnlyFans, but it was later announced that Vega’s association with the platform was a direct breach of the rules, which angered CEO Vince McMahon, causing the organization to release her from her deal.</p><p>Vega’s account under her cosplay name “Megan Minx” was dedicated to her cosplay outfits, which also included a sultry Catwoman.</p><img

a strict “no nudes” policy, she offered her subscribers exclusive videos and photos of her cosplays, swimsuits, lingerie, and more.</p><p>Some of her most famous cosplays on the platform included Poison Ivy, and Mortal Combat, among others.</p><p>Please read the whole article to know more about her subscription rate, earnings from the platform, and more.</p><p>But before hopping into the
