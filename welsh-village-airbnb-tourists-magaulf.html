There are just too many of them.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>“There's parties and there has even been fights in the village after people have drunk too much.”</p><p>The carer added: “There's little affordable housing here now. I'm worried my kids won't be able to find anywhere to live and will have to move away.</p><p>“It all chips away and young families have to move as landlords sell up and then the <a href=#>schools</a> become empty. We'll lose our Welsh identity.”</p><p>Emlyn Baylis, 74, a retired <a href=#>pub</a> landlord, said he knew a woman whose street was taken over by Airbnbs, leaving her without any neighbours and so she became lonely and eventually called it a day.</p><p>However, while he said there were too many visitors he didn’t agree with how some of the locals were protesting, saying the sticker campaign was “too much”.</p><p>Jane Grover, 61, a hotel landlady who runs the Erw Fair guest house said the hotel owner next door had sold up and it was being turned into an Airbnb with six or eight bedrooms.</p><p>She said people were worried it would turn into a “party house”.</p><p>Jane added that a lady over the road lives next door to an Airbnb and she says it’s a nightmare due to all the parties where people get “drunk and very rowdy”.</p><p>The landlady though admitted she had used Airbnb at times in order to fill her rooms but said they didn’t get breakfast.</p><p>Emlyn Hughes, 74, a retired civil servant said some locals had built sheds in their gardens so they could rent out their homes to Airbnb guests.</p><p>He did say that his son rents out his place on Airbnb and so didn’t want to blame the company too much.</p><p>Emlyn though did say that it could be tricky to find a <a href=#>parking</a> spot near your home when all the guests arrive.</p><p>A spokesperson for Airbnb told The Sun Online:</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“We recognise that there are tourism challenges in some parts of Wales, and we support the introduction of new rules for short-term lets that will protect everyday families sharing space in their homes, and clamp down on the speculators driving housing and overtourism concerns.</p><p>“Across Wales, the typical Host shares their own home for less than three nights a month, and more than a third say this helps them afford rising mortgage, food and energy costs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mystery-hate-campaign-airbnb-rentals-837972796.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4B6fJJyZ29np5q5tLSMr6ClpJGcsm6tyKuZp5pdqby2vsisq6xlnZa0osHLn2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./tom-hardy-secretly-won-a-martial-arts-tournament-in-england.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Hardy Secretly Won a Martial Arts Tournament in England">&larr;
