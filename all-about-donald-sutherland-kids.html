In particular, Sutherland said that his relationship with his son Kiefer had suffered through the years. "I wasn't present much as a father when Kiefer was young," he said. "He even looks like me — only shorter — but I am very proud of him and I always will be."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland is now close with all five of his children. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>According to Variety</a>, the Canadian actor revealed to attendees at the 2019 Lumière Film Festival that he named his four sons after different filmmakers. "I love filmmakers, I really do," he said. "They are part of my life, and I named my four sons after directors I worked with." For example, Kiefer was named for Warren Kiefer, who directed Sutherland in Castle of the Living Dead.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Donald Sutherland's five children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kiefer-sutherland-57></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kiefer Sutherland, 57</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kiefer Sutherland was born on Dec. 21, 1966, at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, to Sutherland and his then-wife Douglas. Kiefer also has a twin sister named Rachel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like his father, Kiefer is an actor and is perhaps most known for his role on the long-running <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>television drama 24</a>. In 2016, Kiefer opened up to PEOPLE about playing the character Jack Bauer for eight seasons and described the show ending as "the worst breakup" he ever had.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That same year, Kiefer and Sutherland shared the screen for the first time in Forsaken. He told PEOPLE, "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Working with him</a> is something I have wanted to do for 30 years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2020, Kiefer told PEOPLE that he'd consider playing Bauer again. "If someone were to come up with a great idea, whether that's a great two-hour idea to make a film, or if it's a great season idea, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I'm always open to that</a>," he said. "I love playing that character. I love that show. I love the people that I've worked with on it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to acting, Kiefer also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>released his first album</a>, Down in a Hole, in 2016. "I had no intention of making an album. I hear about an actor wanting to do music and my eyes roll back too," he told PEOPLE. "I'm completely aware of the stigma and that's why I never did it." Kiefer co-wrote all 11 of the songs on the album with his friend and producer Jude Cole.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kiefer's musical career proved to be successful. In 2019, he began a two-month European tour, which was cut short when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>slipped and fell on the stairs</a> of his tour bus. Kiefer sustained a serious rib injury and had to cancel the final three dates of the tour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He is also father to actress Sarah Sutherland, whom he shares with his first wife, Camelia Kath. Following his divorce from Kath in 1990, the Designated Survivor star got engaged to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Julia Roberts</a> after meeting on the set of their film Flatliners. The pair planned to get married in 1991 before Roberts called off the wedding days before the event and began a relationship with Kiefer's Lost Boys costar Jason Patric.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Contractor actor then went on to marry Kelly Winn on June 29, 1996, but they separated in 1999. Kiefer officially filed for divorce in 2004, and their divorce was finalized four years later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2007, Keifer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pleaded "no contest"</a> to a DUI after being arrested that September. It was his fourth DUI arrest since 1989.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm very disappointed in myself for the poor judgment I exhibited recently," Kiefer said in a statement at the time. "I'm deeply sorry for the disappointment and distress this has caused my family, friends and co-workers on 24 and at 20th Century Fox. I appreciate the support and concern that has been extended to me these last weeks both personally and professionally."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kiefer spent 48 days in jail</a> following his 2007 charge and was sentenced to an additional five-year probation and a mandatory 18-month alcohol education program.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Kiefer spoke to PEOPLE about his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>relationship with alcohol and why he chose not to stop drinking</a>. "I was never the guy, if something was wrong in my life or something wasn't right, I didn't go drown my sorrows," he said. "One of the things I love to do is go out with my friends and tell stories and have a bunch of drinks. ... I can also look back on my life and tell you very squarely that the only bad things that have ever happened to me in my life have been because I like to go to bars and have drinks with my friends. I would be lying if I told you that there weren't moments where I felt I let it get away from me."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rachel-sutherland-57></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rachel Sutherland, 57</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>George Pimentel/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland's only daughter, Rachel Sutherland, is Kiefer's twin sister. Though Rachel has largely eschewed the spotlight, she works behind the scenes in the entertainment industry as a production manager.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rachel was born on Dec. 21, 1966, at St. Mary's Hospital in London. In 2018, Kiefer told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a> that he was "incredibly close" with Rachel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Being a twin taught me the value of having a companion," he said. "Every time I experienced something I could turn to my left and share it. When I was having my first child I said to my mother, 'My gosh you had two at the same time.' She said, 'Oh, sweetheart, it was fine. By the time you were 2 you were looking after each other.' She made it sound like she'd got a deal, which always made me laugh."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-roeg-sutherland-49></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Roeg Sutherland, 49</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Vanessa Galle/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland and Francine Racette, his third wife, welcomed their son Roeg Sutherland on Feb. 5, 1974, in Los Angeles. Roeg also works in the entertainment industry, albeit in a different way than his father and siblings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Roeg works for talent and sports agency Creative Artists Agency in the company's Media Finance division. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the division oversees the "packing and representation of independently financed films, television and digital content."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Roeg told THR that the independent film community would weather the COVID-19 pandemic because survival is inherent in the business. "We are all thinking outside the box about how to bring packages together, how to have our clients communicate better with the buyer's market," he said. "I feel like people are working harder and smarter than they ever have."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2022, Roeg celebrated the return of audiences to theaters and independent films. "Never has there been more money in the marketplace, ever," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Deadline</a>. "People understand the benefits and risks that come with creating content. There are so many buyers out there that, after it's finished — and it's good — you're going to find a home for it at more favorable terms and with more upside."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rossif-sutherland-45></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rossif Sutherland, 45</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Blackburn/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland and Racette welcomed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rossif Sutherland</a> on Sept. 25, 1978. Rossif was born in Vancouver, Canada, but the family moved to Paris when he was 7 years old. Rossif had no plans to act until he filled in for a student in a film made at Princeton. Rossif told PEOPLE that his performance left his father emotional. "There were tears in his eyes, and he said, 'Kid, that's what you're supposed to do,' " he recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2013 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Post</a>, Rossif explained that he looked up to his father. "I never really had an interest in being an actor, but I was always in awe of what my father did," he said. "I knew how talented he was; it was just never something that I thought I could do or wanted to do. I didn't want to be other people — that's the extent of what I thought acting was."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rossif has dozens of credits to his name, including a turn as Ezra Shaw on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Handmaid's Tale</a>. He was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award for his performance in the 2016 movie River, in which he played a doctor on the run after he accidentally kills a man in Vietnam. Rossif told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Monsters & Critics</a> that the performance was emotionally difficult. "I had anxiety that I had to carry the film and that we had to finish our days having done all the things my director wanted for the story," he told the outlet. "There was anxiety throughout. I only had to amp it up, not play it up. It was an experience like no other for me. I'm usually the actor on set, hired to be an expert at my character and the rest of the time stay out of people's way."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While promoting River, Rossif told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Ex-Press</a> he ignores detractors. "I don't care much about what people think about me," he said. "If they don't like me, they don't like me. You can be the nicest person in the room … it doesn't matter … And I've never been very strategic with my choices, and maybe my career has suffered for it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rossif also starred in the television series Reign from 2013 to 2015.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-angus-sutherland-41></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Angus Sutherland, 41</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Greg Doherty/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sutherland and Racette welcomed their youngest son, Angus Redford Sutherland, on Sept. 3, 1982. Like his older sister Rachel, Angus hasn't spent a lot of time in the spotlight but has worked in front of and behind the camera.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Donald revealed that Angus' middle name is a nod to one of his favorite directors and actors, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Robert Redford</a>. "I wanted to name another son after Robert Redford," Donald told Variety. "But when the child was born [a woman at the maternity ward] said 'no you can't do that, you can't name a child 'Redford.' So we named him Angus — Angus Redford."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZJ2nnpa5pXnSrquhnaKhrq%2BwjKSgnatf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./aventura-band.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Aventura (band) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
