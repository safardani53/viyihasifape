The same role also earned him a Golden Globe in same category.</p><p>He was also appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama in 2005.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/The-Grand-Budapest-Hotel-Actor-Tom-Wilkinson-Dead-at-75-3.jpg><p>Wilkinson and Hardcastle even got a couple of chances to play married couples. They played real-life duo Joe Kennedy Sr. and wife Rose Kennedy in 2011’s The Kennedys miniseries and then a fictional pair in the 2014 action thriller Good People.</p><p>Wilkinson continued working until the end of his life. He reunited with his The Full Monty costars for a six-episode Disney+ mini series earlier this year. He starred opposite <strong>Ruby Rose</strong> and <strong>Sam Heughan</strong> in 2021’s SAS: Red Notice.

He wrote via <a href=#>X</a> (formerly Twitter), “Goodbye Tom Wilkinson, an amazing talent and wonderful human being. Very proud to have worked with him on The Exorcism of Emily Rose.”</p><p>He went on to share his favorite memory of the late actor. “When we wrapped The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I went to him to say goodbye. As I went in for a hug, he turned sideways and put one arm around my shoulder. I said, ‘Well that’s a British hug if I’ve ever had one…'” Derrickson recalled. “He frowned at me, then grabbed my face and kissed me right on the lips for a good five seconds, then declared loudly, ‘Don’t ever insult British affection or sense of romance! We invented the stuff!'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagqpGjsW6u1J2YqZ2jqXqpu9Oeo2aZk6m8s3nTqKRmr5mhuKq60qilZpyVlrFurdNmbm5n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./asos-whistles-backpack-spot-the-difference.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ASOS is selling a 25 backpack that looks just like the 180 Whistles version - can you spot the d">&larr;
