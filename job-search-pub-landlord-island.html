having a public house on the island helps attract people."</p><p>Applications for the job will open in January, with a start date in April.</p><p>Plans for the future of the island were discussed at a council meeting, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> reports.</p><p>Sandra Baines, head of visitor economy and culture, said it was "very much about preserving its beauty, its natural habitat".</p><p>But she warned that life on the remote island has its drawbacks and it is "not the dream people might think it is".</p><p>A note on the pub's website reminds visitors of its off-the-beaten-track location, adding that when making a booking it is important to make any special requests.</p><p>"We will endeavour to cater to any needs but&nbsp;as you will appreciate, we canâ€™t just nip to the shops to buy food!" it reads.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The pub currently serves locally brewed ales from Lakeland Brewhouse, with local spirits including Shed One Gin and Wolftown Gin also available.</p><p>It also offers a range of "freshly prepared food" including breakfast buns, light bites and main meals such as steak and mussels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701207745.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701207746.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000701207591.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>The lighthouse on Kalsoy, one of the Faroe Islands, can lay claim to be the world's loneliest, on a rocky archipelago 200 miles north of Scotland</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoRxgJRxaHJnmqSvbr%2FEmqmcoF2lwqN5y5qlnaSfp7FutdKlmKecXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jordan-fish-19860626-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordan Fish (Pianist) -
