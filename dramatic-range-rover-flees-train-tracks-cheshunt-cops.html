injuring two cops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/86e88a24-f7d5-4620-955e-72ea8d016074.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000666154808.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Land-Rover1.png><p>And a huge manhunt is under way this afternoon as police search for the driver.</p><p>The drama began earlier today when a male and female police officer tried to stop the car at Cheshunt train station and asked the driver to get out of the vehicle.</p><p>Footage filmed from a nearby home records the female officer, who is holding a baton in one hand, shouting: "Get out of the car."</p><p>The male officer can then be heard saying: "Out of the car, out of the car."</p><p>But the driver - who had the windscreen wipers going at top speed, despite today's sunshine - suddenly reversed backwards.</p><h2>COMMUTERS' SHOCK AT CHASE</h2><p>The door was still open, and both officers were shoved backwards along the street.</p><p>Although the female officer managed to get free, the male cop was dragged by the door - before the driver suddenly stepped on the brakes, sending him flying into the road.</p><p>The motorist then carried on reversing, smashing into cars behind the 4x4 and around it.</p><p>Thankfully, neither officer was seriously hurt, police say.</p><p>The car was then driven off at high speed before ending up on the railway line.</p><p>CCTV captured at the crossing shows the vehicle smashing through the barrier, which had been down to let a train pass.</p><p>More footage from the station shows the car skidding on the sleepers and kicking up a cloud of dust as it races along the track.</p><p>It was eventually abandoned on the tracks between Cheshunt and Waltham Cross stations, Herts.</p><p>Police and emergency services were seen swooping on the area earlier this morning.</p><p>At least 10 police cars, an ambulance and a fire crew were at the scene.</p><p>One commuter said the manic driver was dicing with death.</p><p>“There are about six or seven trains an hour around then and he missed rush hour by such a small margin," they said.</p><p>"It’s just crazy, it could have been horrendous.”</p><p>Trains have been disrupted across Hertfordshire, London, Essex and Cambridge, with problems expected until at least 2pm.</p><p>Officers say they were initially called out to reports a stolen car had been driven into the county from Essex - before the driver fled in terrifying style.</p><h2>COPS HURT TRYING TO TAKE DOWN DANGEROUS DRIVER</h2><p>A spokesperson said today: "At around 9.30am on Thursday, our control room was made aware that a stolen vehicle had travelled into Hertfordshire ground from Essex.</p><p>"The vehicle was located in Cheshunt and officers from Essex Police attempted to speak to the driver.</p><p>"The vehicle then made off, injuring two officers and damaging several vehicles in the process.</p><p>"Officers from Hertfordshire attended to assist with the search and the vehicle was found abandoned on nearby train tracks in Windmill Lane.</p><p>"A search of the area is currently being carried out to locate the driver and officers are working alongside British Transport Police to recover the vehicle.</p><p>"It was not struck by a train at any point."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>British Transport Police (BTP) said: "Officers received a report of a car on the railway line in Cheshunt at 9.43am today.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Officers are currently on scene responding to the incident alongside colleagues from Hertfordshire Police and Essex Police."</p><p>National Rail Enquiries said trains running through the station may be cancelled, delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/d8ba370d-0280-4a99-88a3-06d4a82d251b.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/90f1ef9e-82f0-41a6-9a0c-e23305426253.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoJ3fI9pZ2pnlKeurq3ToppmqpGjtKZ50aitnqpdm7mmsdJmq6uZmaN6tb7AnKKsZZOdsrS01KerZpufpcBw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./claude-bautista.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Claude Bautista net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
