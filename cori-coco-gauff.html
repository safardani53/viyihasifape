However, the family moved back to Delray to focus on Corey’s tennis.</p><p>Born to athletic parents, her father, <strong>Corey Gauff, </strong>played college basketball at Georgia State University and worked as a healthcare executive.</p><p>Her mother, Candi Gauff, was a track and field athlete and an educator at Florida State University. Besides, she has two younger brothers, <strong>Codey</strong> and<strong> Cameron</strong>; both are involved in sports early.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Coco-With-Her-Dad-300x248.jpg><p>The young girl spent her childhood in Atlanta, watching tennis played by famous tennis players, especially the <strong>Williams sisters</strong>.</p><p>She started playing tennis at the age of six. Later on, she and her family moved back to Delray Beach, Florida, so that Coco could get proper training from a renowned coach.</p><h3>Further Training&nbsp;</h3><p>After showing a keen interest in tennis, Coco’s parents switched her education to homeschooling to increase her time and focus on training.</p><p>Both parents compromise their careers to focus on Coco’s training. They wanted Coco to play for the National Level Tennis.</p><p>Her father gave her primary tennis training, and her mother used to look after her homeschooling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coco-Gauff-Enjoying-With-Family.jpg><p>However, she appeared in the equivalent exams by showing online credits. Maybe she’ll join the University to pursue her higher education degree in the future.</p><h2>Age Restrictions in Women’s Tennis</h2><p>In 1994, the WTA organized decided to limit proficient competition play to those matured 14 to 17. (More youthful players are not permitted to turn experts.) At 14, a player can partake in eight expert occasions, with the number ascending to 16 competitions for 17-year-olds. Wins can somewhat expand the number of allowed events. However, full star status isn’t permitted until a player arrives at 18.</p><p>These guidelines are planned to safeguard players, to some extent, due to the burnout that Jennifer Capriati experienced in her vocation after turning star at 13. Nonetheless, there have been inquiries concerning whether the design is excessively restricting. As Gauff is allowed a specific number of competitions, she has been slow to ascend in player rankings. Her most elevated positioning to date has been at No. 23.</p><h2>Coco Gauff – Age, Height, And Physical Appearance</h2><p>Young and talented, Simone is 19&nbsp;years old. According to horoscope charts, Gauff is a Pisces.</p><p>And from what we know, the people of this sign are known to be unique, passionate, and empathetic simultaneously.</p><p>She stands at 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m), the average height of female tennis players.</p><p>Furthermore, like many other sports, height plays a significant role in tennis as you can serve much more quickly and reach farther.</p><p>Likewise, Gauff has a well-maintained athletic body weighing around 55 kg. She works out regularly to keep her body in good shape and has a slim body figure with a measurement of 33-26-34 inches with a shoe size of 7.5 (UK).</p><p>Not to mention, Simone has got a pair of black eyes and long black dreadlock hair.

She initially wanted to pursue tennis as her career after winning “Little Mo” eight-and-under nationals at eight.</p><p>She always considered <a href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams</a> as her inspirational model. Speaking in an interview, she said:</p><p>Serena is the reason why I play tennis and why my dad decided to get me a racket</p><p>In the meantime, she was trained by <strong>Gerard Logo</strong> at New Generation Tennis Academy.</p><p>At age ten, Gauff began training at the Mouratoglou Academy run by <strong>Patrick Mouratoglou</strong>, who also taught <strong>Serena Williams</strong> for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Coco-Father-Serving-as-a-Tennis-Coach-for-Her-300x300.jpg><p>Due to financial problems, Coco could not pursue her high-level Tennis training.
