In February 2023, Lively revealed that she and Reynolds had quietly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>welcomed their fourth baby</a>. The actress had previously announced she was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>expecting</a> again when she walked the red carpet in September 2022 with her baby bump on full display.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Lively and Reynolds prefer to keep their kids <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>out of the spotlight</a> and off of social media, they're not shy when it comes to talking about their family life in interviews.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During a discussion at the 2022 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cannes Film Festival</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Reynolds joked</a> about his "wild" daughters, saying, "I'm a parent of three girls. They're wild. I think they have rabies sometimes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All jokes aside, Reynolds has repeatedly stated that he "loves being a girl dad." During an interview for Access, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he said</a>, "I have three daughters, which I never in a million years would imagine. I come from all boys. I have three older brothers. So for me to have three daughters has been such a ride and I love every second of it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lively has said that having kids has made her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>feel more comfortable in her own skin</a>. "I never felt more myself or at ease in my own body or more confident," she told Forbes. "Not to say that there aren't a bevy of insecurities coming at me a million times a day, but I just feel incredibly settled."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While both Reynolds and Lively are actors, the Deadpool star won't let their kids <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>get into the industry</a> — at least not until they're older. "Putting a kid in a business like this, it's generally not about the kid," Reynolds told PEOPLE at the American Cinematheque Awards in November 2022. "It's usually about the parents."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When they're older, they can do whatever the hell they want," he added. "I'm excited for that. Our job is to foster as much interest in as many different things as possible at this point."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Reynolds and Lively <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>took all four kids to a Wrexham AFC soccer game</a> in Wales. The Adam Project star, who co-owns the team, ran around on the field with his family before the match began.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The following month, Ryan Reynolds compared Wrexham's dramatic 3-2 victory over Notts County <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>to the birth of his children</a>, saying, "Aside from the birth of my kids, this day was up there for me, emotionally."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, Lively took James and Inez to see <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aunt Taylor Swift perform in Philadelphia</a>. The pop star spotted the little girls mid-show and shouted, "Hi James!

In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The MR PORTER Post</a>, Reynolds revealed that they named their daughter James after his father, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>passed away</a> shortly after she was born. "It felt right," Reynolds explained, adding that before his father died, "he got to see her, which makes me happy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about the "unusual" name choice for a girl on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning Britain</a>, Reynolds joked, "In the spectrum of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>weird celebrity baby names</a>, I don't really feel like we're breaking new ground here. I didn't call her Summer Squash Meadowlark."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">James had her first big celebrity moment when she was just 2 years old, making an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a>'s album <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Reputation</a>. James is the baby heard during the opening of "Gorgeous," and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Swift credited her</a> in the album booklet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Good Morning America</a>, Lively admitted that when she and Reynolds heard their daughter's voice at Swift's concert, she started jumping up and down and filming on her phone while Reynolds threw his hands in the air. "We were very embarrassing," Lively said. "This is the true, unfiltered version of our terrible stage-parent pride."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>interview for Sirius XM's The Jess Cagle Show</a>, Reynolds shared that his daughters, for the longest time, had no idea that Swift was a famous pop star.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And then they went to a concert one day and were like, 'Ohhhhh, this isn't a hobby,' " he said, adding that listening to Aunt Taylor's music has become "like a religion in our house."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2023, Reynolds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>took James to Wales</a> where they watched a Wrexham match. The Deadpool star was seen holding James' hand while walking through the stands at The Racecourse Ground and he was photographed talking to people during the match as James patiently waited.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-inez-reynolds-7></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Inez Reynolds, 7</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frank Trapper/Corbis</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lively and Reynolds' second daughter, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Inez Reynolds</a>, was born in New York on Sept. 30, 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with PEOPLE, Lively <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clarified the correct spelling of her daughter's name</a>. "I had a new baby, Inez, with a 'z' even though everyone says it's with an 's.' I don't know why," she said. "Please tell Wikipedia."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Reynolds, Inez has a bit of a "dark side." On <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Live with Kelly and Ryan</a>, the proud dad talked about Inez's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>favorite characters</a>. "She's super into villains," he shared. "We watch <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Beauty and the Beast</a> and her favorite character is Gaston."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued to joke about her spunky personality, noting that even her doctor has noticed. "Our pediatrician, when she met Inez, she said, 'Oh, this one's shady,' " Reynolds shared. "Even the other day, when we were traveling back home, we were at the airport and out of our whole family she's the only one that got the secondary security pat down at 2 years old. She just takes it like a hard-earned felon."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inez also has a stylish side. In 2021, Lively <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a video</a> of an outfit Inez picked out for her to wear: a floral skirt, a hot pink sweatshirt with a rhinestone smiley face and black pumps with a fuzzy pink heel. "When you try to get your 4 year old dressed but they insist on dressing you instead … at 5am," she wrote.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-betty-reynolds-4></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Betty Reynolds, 4</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steven Ferdman/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Betty Reynolds</a> was born on Oct. 4, 2019. While Lively and Reynolds haven't explicitly explained why they chose their third daughter's name, the Gossip Girl alum has said that it's a family moniker. She explained that the name of her non-alcoholic sparkling mixers, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Betty Buzz</a>, was inspired by her father and his mother, Betty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My dad's name was Ernest Brown Jr., but he was known as Ernie Lively," she wrote in a press release. "He gave up his last name when he married my mom and any success he, or I, have experienced has been in a name that isn't his. So when I was working hard to build this company, I wanted any success to be in a name that was meaningful to him. Betty was his mom and his sister's name."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lively's good friend Swift was actually the one to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>confirm the little girl's name publicly</a> with her song "Betty." The track also references the couple's other two girls, with lyrics, "You heard the rumors from Inez / You can't believe a word she says" and "She said, 'James, get in, let's drive.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, Lively revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Inez had difficulty adjusting</a> to Betty's arrival. "It's a bit of a tough adjustment in our house, but it's good," she told host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jimmy Fallon</a> on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>The Tonight Show</a>.

In the first photo, the couple posed for a photo with Lively's mom and the actress no longer had a baby bump. "Puppy Bowl Sunday 2023🥘 🍲 🥧 been busy," she wrote in the caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair had revealed they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>becoming a family of six</a> in September 2022. Lively walked the red carpet at the 10th Annual Forbes Power Women's Summit in a sequined mini dress with her baby bump on full display. PEOPLE then confirmed the pregnancy news.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Lively posted a carousel of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>baby bump photos on Instagram</a>, which included snaps with Reynolds and Swift.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the pictures were happy, the caption was not. It was clear that the Gossip Girl star only shared the photos to appease the paparazzi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Here are photos of me pregnant in real life so the 11 guys waiting outside my home for a 🦄 sighting will leave me alone," Lively captioned the post. "You freak me and my kids out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2022, Reynolds talked about the sex of the baby, admitting that he hopes the couple's fourth child <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>will be a girl</a>. "I know girls, so I'm kind of hoping that," the actor said on the Today show. The proud father joked that his preference stems from being one of three brothers. "I love my well-being and my home," he said, teasing that his siblings "were just arsonists and firemen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, it seems the couple were waiting to know the sex until delivery. Reynolds noted that he and Lively "never find out 'til [they're born]."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2023, Reynolds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>mentioned his youngest child</a> when he announced his new series,&nbsp;Bedtime Stories With Ryan&nbsp;on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The father of four shared a video that featured him preparing to read a book to a pair of animatronic sheep and a clip of him relaxing on a rooftop. In the caption, the actor wrote that "the idea for a show made to help everyone fall asleep was born the same day as my fourth child."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZJukkaCybrjIr5ylsV2nxqK6jKucsqafobG0ecKhoKWcopq7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./e-n-young.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="E.N Young">&larr;
