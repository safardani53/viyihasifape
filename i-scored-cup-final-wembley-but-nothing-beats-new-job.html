She is from the sort of family that you want to breed from as well as she is so tough.</p><p>"This is Marsh Wren’s time of year, and this is her trip. This is her cup final, and we planned to go here even before she won her last start. </p><p>"From what both Stu and (jockey) Ciaran Gethings have said she is looking in savage form at home.</p><p>"Her biggest strength is her tenaciousness. There is nothing soft about her, she is just so hardy and tough."</p><p>The same could be said about Turner and his approach to racing and punting.</p><p>He told <a href=# aria-label="Under The Cosh (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Under The Cosh</a> about his brilliant <a href=#>Cheltenham</a> bet nearly ten years ago - which would have returned a lot more had Annie Power not infamously fell when clear in the Mares' Hurdle.</p><p>That blunder saved bookies £50million but Turner still got three of out four winners.</p><p>He said: "I was trying to persuade the other boys to have the bet on the Willie Mullins four who were all roughly even money.</p><p>"I said we should split it and put £7,000 on them and we get £15,000 back, we just needed one of Annie Power, Faugheen, Douvan or Un De Sceaux to cross the line in front to get our money back.</p><p>"Three of the four won but only Fabio followed on the bet with me.</p><p>"I told the other lads to follow but they said 'oh the missus won't be happy'.</p><p>"Fabio said he was with me and I said, 'we'll be all right Fab, we'll be all right'.</p><p>"The third one goes in and we were guaranteed £20,000 up each and Fabio is absolutely buzzing, he's p***ed off his head, absolutely loving it.</p><p>"He's passing his phone round letting all the staff place bets, absolutely brilliant.</p><p>"I remember we were walking out the course and he goes 'I love you Ben, man' and I said 'I love you too!'"</p><p>Turner's involved in a different crowd these days, but maybe a Cheltenham runner will be on the cards in the future.</p><p>He explained: "Marsh Wren was purchased on a shoestring budget and we have 30 people involved in her including several members of my family.</p><p>"What is great about the syndicate is that they are all working class people who have normal jobs.</p><p>"We haven’t got the resources to spend big money out of the point-to-point field but here they are with a horse in a Listed race.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"When I was playing football I was fortunate enough to have half and quarter shares in horses, along with own one outright, but being in a syndicate like this is no less of a buzz. </p><p>"We have people in their 20s right through to their 70s involved so we have the full age scale which is great to see."</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
