You can transform the look of your home quickly — and more easily than you think — with traditional wallpaper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wallpaper comes in many colors and patterns, but it’s also come a long way in terms of its application. Spray-and-stick wallpaper and water-activated wallpaper have been known to transform some into veritable DIY warriors. But where do you start with choosing the right wallpaper for your home?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There are four things you need to consider when you’re buying wallpaper: style, size, type, and pattern,” says Mary Patton, owner and designer at Mary Patton Design in Houston. Style refers to the design of the room and the feeling you want your space to convey, she says. Size matters, too: Do you want to cover the whole room or house or just an accent wall or two? Then comes the type of wallpaper and how it’s applied — some are so easy to handle and hang, you’ll feel like a design pro.&nbsp;"Finally, pattern is the fun part,” Patton says. “You can choose bold color patterns or go for something subtle and soft. The choice is completely up to you.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are countless wallpaper choices, in fact. That’s why our PEOPLE Tested team did much of the legwork for you. We evaluated 29 products based on ease of application, design, durability, and overall value. We worked individually to install the wallpaper, so take heart, solo DIYers: With a bit of patience, this can indeed be a one-person job. We also noted how well the wallpaper cleaned up from splashes of coffee, smudges of barbecue sauce, and even streaks of black crayon. Months later, we checked in on the wallpaper samples to see how well they were all hanging in there before finalizing our selections for this list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to see all PEOPLE Tested pick's of the best wallpaper.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-serena--lily-priano-wallpaper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Serena & Lily Priano Wallpaper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Serena &amp;amp; Lily Priano Wallpaper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WlHXvulY-mYfvQIb3qUDSiGav6k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/serena-and-lily-priano-wallpaper-dcf8b14370424e9bb80a1079c3a200b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Serena & Lily</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Easy to apply despite needing glue</p></li><li readability=0><p>Thick, high-quality paper</p></li><li readability=-1><p>No staining or color fading from the cleaning test</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wallpaper is notoriously difficult to work with, so it’s a pretty big deal that the Priano wallpaper from Serena & Lily earned its spot as best overall. This high-quality wallpaper proved to be not only attractive but surprisingly simple to hang. This wallpaper was very easy to work with, and we were impressed by its smooth, bubble-free application. We also liked the vine pattern, which comes in five different color choices.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Serena & Lily wallpaper also has a nice, thick texture. You might think that would spell trouble for cutting the paper, but we found it was easy to cut — just another reason it nabbed the top spot on this list. You do need glue to hang this wallpaper, and we were happy to see that there was no bleeding when the glue was applied.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At $128 per roll, it’s no cheap purchase, but we gave it high marks for value based on the quality of the paper and its ease of application. Whether wiping away excess glue or stains during the cleaning test, we found there was no leftover staining or color fading, which bodes very well for the durability and longevity of this wallpaper.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Unpasted paper | <strong>Roll Size: </strong>27 inches x 27 feet |<strong> Coverage Per Roll:</strong> 60.75 square feet | <strong>Colors: </strong>Navy, Sky, Pink Sand, Mink, Grove</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-graham--brown-crocodile-black-wallpaper></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Graham & Brown Crocodile Wallpaper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Graham &amp;amp; Brown Crocodile Black Wallpaper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/atjLgAIIecXK3K8jgLWphARAfAU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/graham--brown-crocodile-black-wallpaper-8f5180682a0d4e1a8de7b58476d9edcc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Home Depot</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to add a dramatic accent wall without a lot of drama during your DIY installation, this black crocodile print vinyl wallpaper from Graham & Brown is the way to go. It’s got a nice weight and texture that made it easy to smooth out for a bubble-free application. The paper does have a rubbery consistency that made it tricky to cut, though, so make sure you have sharp cutting tools on hand to avoid any issues.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cleaning takes just a damp cloth and a bit of soapy water. We found that the coffee and barbecue sauce stains came off easily, but the crayon marks took a bit of effort because they got into the crevices, but they eventually did come off. The glue remained stuck, however.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the black print is too bold for your space, this paper also comes in blue and green, as well.

There were some air pockets that needed to be smoothed out, but it was thick enough to avoid ripping and we were able to smooth out the bubbles as we went.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for cleaning, this Magnolia Home wallpaper is built to last. A simple swipe with a moist cloth or a gentle rub of a Magic Eraser got all stains out with no leaking, staining or tearing. At the end of the day, if you prefer a neutral color palette but also want some subtle style for your household (especially if that household contains children), you can’t go wrong with this wallpaper choice from Magnolia Home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Matte SureStrip (pre-pasted) | <strong>Roll Size: </strong>20.5 inches x 33 feet<strong> </strong>|<strong> Coverage Per Roll:</strong> 56 square feet | <strong>Colors/Patterns: </strong>Black, Blue, Grey, White</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=4139 data-sizes=750px alt="Magnolia Home By Joanna Gaines Pick Up Sticks Spray and Stick Wallpaper displays against white wall" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/eej1f7bVN56iUHbp7GKtnXOYKhY=/fit-in/1500x4139/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO_MagnoliaHomeByJoannaGainesPickUpSticksSprayandStickWallpaperatHomeDepot_HW_27-7e937d34d574424ca4a3611d6feaa4e9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Henry Wortock</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=4033 data-sizes=750px alt="Person pasting Magnolia Home By Joanna Gaines Pick Up Sticks Spray and Stick Wallpaper on the white wall" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nF4QZPs2w3Mg2K32CN9Cj5mgJ-Q=/fit-in/1500x4033/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/traditional-wallpaper-test-magnolia-home-joanna-gaines-pick-up-sticks-spray-stick-home-depot-dburreson-348-9cad093929b14aeb8b74606ff229a86f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dera Burreson</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spray--stick-less-expensive-joss--main-nautical-living-wallpaper-roll></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Spray & Stick, Less Expensive</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Joss & Main Nautical Living Wallpaper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Joss &amp;amp; Main Nautical Living 33' L x 20.5&amp;quot; W Wallpaper Roll" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/udnDAhoMxcZZHAChUmvu-rAtxoU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joss-main-faded-denim-blue-nautical-living-33-l-x-205-w-wallpaper-roll-41f016fb7e4c4b2792be548699ba5cb3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Joss & Main</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Spray-and-stick wallpaper sounds like it would be easier to hang, and we confirmed that theory after trying out this one from Joss and Main. This wallpaper was very easy to apply and it was less messy than most of the ones that require glue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It certainly helped that the textured pattern — which comes in three different colors — was easy to line up. We were impressed with the thickness of this high-quality wallpaper, though that thickness did make it difficult to cut when fitting the paper around an electrical outlet. The pattern isn't too bold or outlandish, so it makes for a great neutral wall if you’re looking to upgrade from plain paint.

To hang this wallpaper, you’ll need to apply glue to the wall, which we found simple to do with a paint roller. The manufacturer has designed the application method to be rather foolproof — the paper comes in A, B, and C strips, so as long as you know your alphabet, you’ll apply it in the right order.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design featured rich, saturated colors that impressed us, while the paper has a nice, smooth finish that’s also durable — it didn’t fade or smear when stains were wiped away easily during the cleaning test. At $220 a roll, it can be a daunting purchase, but this price does include three rolls.

Like choosing paint, you’ll want to buy a high-quality wallpaper that will literally hold up over time, as well as stand up to the wear and tear of everyday living. “Any wallpaper that’s pre-pasted is good,” says Patton. “It saves a lot of time and is easier for application.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is more expensive wallpaper worth it?</span></p><p>“More expensive wallpaper is definitely worth it,” says Patton. “It usually lasts longer and is of higher quality. If you can splurge on it, I’d think it’d be worth the price.” Farinas agrees. “​​Usually the more expensive the wallpaper is, the more options you have,” she says.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How long does spray-and-stick wallpaper last?</span></p><p>Wallpaper does come with a bit of a learning curve.
