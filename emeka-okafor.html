However, he had tremendous pressure on himself as the best player. But he did a great job, which proves he is a good player.</p><p>However, Okafor continuously had a feud with the head coach. Despite rivalries, he managed to perform well in his games.</p><p>Finally, in 2009 Emeka ended the season with 93-92 (consecutive game played- straight match started).</p><h3>2009-2017</h3><ul><li>Later, in exchange for Tyson Chandler, Oakfor was drafted to New Orleans Hornets.</li><li>In 2011 he played his first-ever series of NBA seasons.</li><li>Likewise, in 2012 Oakfor was drafted to Washington Lizards.

They’re not bad! I can’t get everyone!” in a harsh voice that was not welcoming.</p><p>This was just the focal gist of the response that Calhoun gave. We didn’t understand why he was fired, but he said, “ I can’t take every player. We have 13 scholarships.”</p><p>And later, Calhoun apologized, realizing that lashing out was his bad, and he should not have done that in front of his peers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Emeka is only active on Twitter and has 20.5k followers.
