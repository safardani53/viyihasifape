But the truth is that he just turned 21.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Known for creating a bit of drama here and there, his 21st birthday, too, became a source of a lot of tea.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Jaden Hossler's Big 21st Birthday Bash</h2><p>Hossler, more commonly known by his professional moniker&nbsp;jxdn, had a&nbsp;birthday bash on February 8, 2022, in celebration of turning 21. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He held an open warehouse party for everyone to come together and celebrate. A lot of VIPs and A-listers were present at the event.</p><p>Hossler performed alongside Machine Gun Kelly in the concert. In a few videos that have since gone viral, he was seen performing at what looked to be a big concert for the guests.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The guests included <a href=# rel=follow>Bryce Hall</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Tana Mongeau</a>, Michelle Kennelly, JROD, <a href=# rel=follow>Charly Jordan</a>, Mattsworldd, and Kenji, among others. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, these were just the ones that attended. The invitation list seemed to be much longer, with a few daring and controversial choices.</p><h2>Jaden Hossler Invited Girlfriend Nessa Barrett's Ex Boyfriends</h2><p>Among Hossler's guest choices, two stood out to&nbsp;everyone paying attention on&nbsp;the internet â€” <a href=# rel=follow>Josh Richards</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Mads Lewis</a>. They are his girlfriend <a href=# rel=follow>Nessa Barrett</a>'s ex boyfriends.</p><p>These revelations came out around the same time the clips from his concert went viral. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>TikTok Insiders, a TikTok gossip account&nbsp;on Instagram, uploaded a video on February 8. In the clip, Richards discussed his invitation to Hossler's party with another friend.</p><p>He was arguing about going to the party with his friend. "Should I just pull up?" he contemplated at one point.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, he decided against the idea as the video ended. "I'm not going to his birthday. {expletive} that." he quipped at the end of the clip. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>People were perplexed at Hossler's decision to invite Richards in the comment section.</p><p>Some were amazed that he had the guts to do that, while many others wondered if he just wanted to start drama. After all, <a href=# rel=follow>the two had a feud going</a> for a while in the past.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, Lewis, according to fans' detective work, was present at the party.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>According to a post by The original Tiktokroom on February 9, Lewis was spotted at the party.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In a side-by-side comparison, the post showed someone standing behind Hossler at the party with a beanie on.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The beanie seemed to match the one that Lewis was wearing in the adjacent picture.</p><p>The above snapshot of Lewis was taken from a video from the party, which is the source of another big spectacle. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Jaden&nbsp;Hossler and Karin Moskalensky were 'way too close'</h2><p>Hossler's party was an open warehouse, which meant anybody could come and join in on the fun. That also meant a lot of unintended interactions for the birthday boy and a lot of rumors.</p><p>Something like this happened when Karin Moskalensky posted a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video with Hossler</a>. In the video, she was hugging the man of the hour tightly from behind as they shared a laugh.</p><p>Unfortunately, the video TikTok Insiders posted had no sound, so we do not know what they were saying.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This intimacy between the two prompted fans to spam Moskalensky's&nbsp;Instagram posts with comments.</p><p>Many of them suggested she respect&nbsp;other people's relationships, implying he was Barrett's boyfriend.</p><p>A few others wanted to know if Barrett was around when that video was taken. They also wondered if Hossler had agreed to the intimacy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, in the comment section of the TikTok Insiders post, people were not surprised.</p><p>Many opined that this was bound to happen. Some even claimed he had cheated on Barrett with Moskalensky and that the intimacy was nothing new.</p><p>The video made the rounds and became so huge that Hossler felt the need to address the situation on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On February 9, he penned a few words regarding this and similar interactions from the party.</p><p><img alt="Jaden Hossler addressed his birthday drama with Karin Moskalensky." height=1073 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/Jaden-Hossler-birthday-drama-post.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Jaden Hossler addressed his birthday drama with Karin Moskalensky.</strong> (Photo: Jaden Hossler/Instagram)</p><p>He said that he took pictures and videos with many people at the party because it was an open warehouse. "Mad" people came up to him and took photos and videos.</p><p>"PLEASE CHILL U KNOW NOTHING," he wrote, proceeding&nbsp;to call people wanting drama "annoying" and claimed there were no problems at the party.</p><p>In a subsequent post, he just wrote the words "Weirdos" on top of his disgusted face.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Barrett, too, posted a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birthday wish</a> for her boyfriend, again, implying there were no issues between her and her "lover boy"&nbsp;because of the videos.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKRmbKveceoqqyklad6o7XRrZ%2BdmalisbOtzJploaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jon-hamm.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jon Hamm Biography">&larr;
