The “Maggie May” singer has been married to former model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Penny Lancaster</strong></a> since 2007. Penny, 52, stepped back into the spotlight when she worked as a special constable with the City of London Police at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Queen Elizabeth’s state funeral</a> in September 2022. Rod, meanwhile, is busy continuing to prosper in his music career, and he’s set to perform during CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live with Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen&nbsp;on December 31.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Here’s everything to know about Penny Lancaster and Rod’s other marriages below!.</p><h2>Rod Stewart’s Wife, Penny</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Penny started modeling at a young age. One of her most notable campaigns was when she was offered £200,000 to be the model for lingerie and swimwear brand Ultimo in 2002, via<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Evening Standard.</a> Despite the massive payout, the deal did lead to some drama when the company rescinded the offer and instead gave the job to Rod’s ex-wife&nbsp;<strong>Rachel Hunter</strong>. Rod took to Instagram to share a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>snapshot</a> (see above) of him and his wife on June 11, 2022. “Love my life,” he captioned the romantic post.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After the debacle, a spokesman for Penny’s agent told&nbsp;Evening Standard&nbsp;that she had become more selective of the products she advertises. “We are being very careful about which projects she will pursue. We have moved away from lingerie for good. The new projects in the offing involve much more upmarket clothing,” he said at the time. “Penny would rather promote a product that she believes in and what in her view is a responsible and respectable product. She wouldn’t promote anything just for money.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Other than modeling, Penny has had a very successful career in TV. She’s been a presenter on the talk show&nbsp;Loose Women&nbsp;since 2014, after making a handful of appearances on the show in years prior, with her earliest being 2006. Other than&nbsp;Loose Women, she also competed on&nbsp;Strictly Come Dancing&nbsp;(a British <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dance competition</a> show, similar to&nbsp;Dancing With the Stars) in the show’s fifth series in 2007.</p><h2>Their Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Rod is the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>father of eight children,</a> ranging in age from 12 to 60. Penny is the mother of his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two youngest children:</a>&nbsp;<strong>Alastair Wallace</strong>,&nbsp;18, and <strong>Aiden Patrick</strong>, 12. It’s been revealed that Alastair is a great swimmer, with Rod reportedly building a massive swimming pool in his U.K. mansion to help him prepare for the Olympics. Aiden arrived after Penny went through IVF treatment, and her husband reportedly called the youngest son the couple’s “miracle baby.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>During a November 2021 appearance on&nbsp;Loose Women, Rod<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> opened up</a> about what it was like seeing his wife go through menopause, and he offered sound advice to any men who may be unsure of how to react when they see their partners going through the same thing. “We talked about it, which I think is the most important thing a couple can do, and she explained it to me through the tears – because Penny likes a cry, and we talked it through, and I think that’s what couples have to do, and men have just got to get on with it, understand, and come out the other end,” he said at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>His daughter, <strong>Kimberly</strong>, 44, even took to Instagram to share an adorable <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family snapshot</a> (see above) on July 7, 2021. “Reunited with this crew @penny.lancaster @sirrodstewart @seanstewart @ali_stewart_05 @renee__stewart,” she captioned the post. And later, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>solo photo</a> of her pops on June 18, 2022. “@sirrodstewart in his realm @therealm_ks @letthelordbewithyou #happyfathersday,” she wrote.</p><h2>His Marriage To Alana Stewart</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Before Penny, Rod had had many different relationships, which included him fathering six children with four other women. His first marriage was to model and actress&nbsp;<strong>Alana Stewart </strong>from 1979 to 1984, and they had two children. Rod admitted that he thinks that they had married too young in a November 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. He mentioned that his father had rightly told him that he wasn’t ready for marriage. “I still had a lot of living, partying, drinking and shagging to do,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>With Alana, he had his daughter&nbsp;Kimberly in August 1979. Kimberly’s followed in her mom’s footsteps and become a model, as well as an actress and TV personality. She had a short-lived reality series Living With… Kimberly Stewart&nbsp;in 2007, and has had minor roles in shows like&nbsp;Undeclared&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hercule Poirot. She also gave birth to her daughter (and Rod’s granddaughter)&nbsp;<strong>Delilah</strong>, 12, in August 2011. Alana also had a son <strong>Sean</strong>, 43, with Rod. Sean was a star of the reality show Sons of Hollywood.</p><h2>Rod’s Second Wife, Rachel Hunter</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>The singer’s second marriage was to Rachel Hunter from 1990 until 2006. Rod and Rachel also had <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids.</a> Rod mentioned that his second marriage ending really hurt him, but he met Penny shortly after the split. “Rachel broke up with me on a Monday evening, and it was heartbreaking,” he told People.&nbsp;“[Penny] has mended my heart in more ways than one.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>From his marriage to Rachel, Rod had his daughter <strong>Renee</strong>, 31, in June 1992, and son <strong>Liam</strong>, 29, in September 1994. Between his first and second marriage, Rod dated model <strong>Kelly Emberg,&nbsp;</strong>whom he had his daughter&nbsp;<strong>Ruby Stewart</strong>, 36, with. His first daughter&nbsp;<strong>Sarah Streeter</strong>, 60, was born in 1963 to&nbsp;<strong>Susannah Boffey&nbsp;</strong>and raised by adopted parents.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Gom2arpJrEor7TZq6inpVigXd8kWttamc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./joshua-hongs-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Joshua Hong Dating  Joshua Hong's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
