These other loyal animals have waited in hope by their masters’ graves.</p><p><strong>When Wagner de Lim Figueiredo, 34, died in northeast Brazil last January, mourners were amazed as Sereno the horse sighed in grief as he “wanted to say goodbye” to his beloved owner. The saddened crowd watched him whimper and stomp on the ground.</strong></p><p>“Deta, you have to leave the cemetary, come on”, Theresa Morini’s husband shouted to poor pooch Deta who couldn’t quite leave his 86 year old wife’s gravestone in New York. He later had to carry him back to the car.</p><p><strong>Andrea Cossu died after a building collapsed on him during an earthquake in Pescara del Tronto in August 2016. But his committed canine Flash wouldn’t stop pawing at his coffin, holding out hope his owner would emerge unscathed.</strong></p><p>Saddened dog Cesur visits old owner Mehmet Illhan’s grave in northwest Turkey every single day. He painfully watched his master being lowered into the ground but will never forget him.</p><p><strong>In September 2017, a video went viral in Malaysia showing an unknown mysterious cat circling the grave of a kitty-loving grandpa called Ismail. His relatives tried to lure away the feline by playing with it but it refused to leave his burial ground.</strong></p><p>Considering the monument would be placed in a public space this still needs to be decided and passed on to local institutions.</p><p>Members of the Foundation of Animal Protection (FUPA) requested for Capitans remains to be buried next to the owner.</p><p>Some have suggested the remains should be embalmed.</p><p>Currently, the remains are under the surveillance of FUPA members.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Capitan follows in the tracks of Hachiko, an Akita dog which is said to have waited at a Tokyo train station for its master to return each day for nine years from May 1925, following owner Hidesaburo Ueno’s death at work.</p><p>The most famous tale of a dog’s devotion beyond the grave is Greyfriars Bobby— a Skye Terrier which allegedly spent 14 years guarding the Edinburgh grave of John Gray, dying itself in January 1872.</p><p>A statue and commemorative fountain were built at the southern end of the George IV Bridge.</p><p>Several books and films have been based on Bobby’s life, but recent Cardiff University research claims Bobby was a publicity stunt by local businesses to drum up tourist revenue…using TWO trained dogs to ‘stand guard’ in the graveyard.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Amazing footage shows a terrier scampering up a near-vertical Scots rockface</span><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
