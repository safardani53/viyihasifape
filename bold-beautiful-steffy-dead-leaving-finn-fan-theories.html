Both Steffy AND Finn? Would they REALLY kill off Steffy?”</p><p>Another wrote: “Yeah, if BOTH Steffy and Finn don't end up alive and thriving, I'm never watching again”</p><p>A third furious viewer said: “They have Steffy and Finn bleeding out on trash bags and just threw #Sinn rings in the trash.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s where this show is going for me. In the trash.&nbsp;</p><p>“They are literally telling me - nothing left here for you.”</p><p>Others said they are absolutely “shook” by this storyline and are very worried about “poor Steffy and Finn.”</p><p>All of this comes after Friday's cliffhanger episode.</p><p>Steffy learned that Sheila caused Stef's step-mom, Brooke, to relapse by switching out her non-alcoholic champagne with the real version.</p><p>After alerting Finn of this, Steffy told her husband she was going to confront his mom about it&nbsp;about it at Il Giardino.</p><p>He became increasingly worried about the mother of his child when she wouldn’t respond to his texts and decided to leave work to rush over the Italian restaurant he knew they'd be at.</p><p>Finn got there just as Sheila had raised a gun at Steffy out back by the dumpster, and he jumped in front and was shot instead.</p><p>Shocked, Steffy ran over to try to wake her unconscious husband and to try to stop all of the blood, screaming as she realized how much there was.</p><p>As she worked to dial 9-1-1 for help, Sheila once again pointed the gun at her and forbade her from finishing the call.</p><p>Fans rushed to social media after the episode to share their fear over Finn's likely death, before going on to do the same after Monday's episode for both his and Steffy's possible deaths.</p><p>Tanner, who's married to&nbsp;<a href=#>Vampire Diaries</a>&nbsp;alum Kayla Ewell, has not yet spoken out about the cliffhanger ending or whether or not he's leaving the series.</p><p>Neither has Jacqueline about her status on the show.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The actress is currently pregnant with her third child with her husband Elan Ruspoli.</p><p>"Elan and I dreamed of having a large family as we are both only children and are over the moon that our dreams are coming true,"&nbsp;she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>&nbsp;of the baby news back in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000723907310.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000723201091.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htYGp9c3%2BTaJmopJRir6at1K2gn62cYsC1scWfsGaclZaxbrjEmq2ippdis6q6zWadmqZdqbWmu9GinKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./blac-chyna-meme.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blac Chyna Meme - The Hollywood Gossip">&larr;
