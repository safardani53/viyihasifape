There are colour-protectors, anti-frizz saviours, volume-boosters and so much more.</p><p>If your hair is dry, you're technically only supposed to shampoo twice a week, whereas more oily hair can require a hair wash on a daily basis (if you can be bothered, that is).</p><p>Usually, you can tell by looking at your hair when it needs a wash.</p><p>We're not saying don't shampoo when your hair's dripping with sweat from a workout just because you washed it the day before.</p><p>As there are so many shampoos out there in 2022, we decided it's time to test out the best shampoos around so your hair can look its best.</p><h2>Best shampoos at a glance:</h2><h2>Hairstory New Wash Original</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewWashOriginal.png><ul><li><strong>New Wash Original, £42 from Hair Story - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Hair Story is here to debunk everything you thought you knew about shampoos with its New Wash Original, the shampoo and conditioner alternative.</p><p>It's £44, but you're basically getting two-in-one as this is all you need for your hair wash, combining ingredients of natural cleansing oils and keratin, entirely free of the detergents found in classic products.</p><p>As Hair Story says, ordinary shampoos and conditioners strip your hair of its protective oil barrier and consequently your hair gets greasy, we were really excited to try this as a replacement because we usually end up having to wash our hair after one day because of grease.</p><p>Our main concern was not being able to use conditioner, but the texture is soft as ever and when you apply it using a scalp brush (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">theirs is £11</a>), you can really get to your scalp for a deep clean that also feels great.</p><p>Even after one wash, we could see what all their fuss was about. Our hair felt immediately lighter, softer and the floral scent lasted for ages after washing, which was a lovely bonus.</p><p>There's no denying that this acts as both a shampoo and conditioner because your hair feels clean and moisturised, but our only complaint is that we tried out the 8OZ pack which will probably be gone in a few weeks, so we'd definitely go for one of the bigger sizes next time.</p><p>We can't wait to see the long-term results of not using harsh shampoo and conditioner.</p><h2>Olaplex No 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ola002_no4bondmaintenanceshampoo_1560x1960-tihy6.jpg><ul><li><strong>No 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo, £28 from CultBeauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Loved by the Kardashians and just about every celebrity hair stylist, Olaplex has a reputation to live up to with its No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo.</p><p>The clue's in the name as this best-selling favourite aims to repair, strengthen and revitalise damaged hair by deeply moisturising it.</p><p>In short, we had high expectations. The thick-textured, sweet-scented formula smells great and feels as though you are giving your hair an intense yet soft wash when you use it.</p><p>Upon the first use, we were happy with how clean our hair felt, but that's where our praises halted as I was expecting salon-fresh, shiny results but our frizzy hair looked not much different to how it does after other, much cheaper shampoos.</p><p>Although our tresses definitely stayed looking freshly washed for longer than usual, we decided to keep going to see if the impact would be more dramatic if we continued to use it.</p><p>After three washes, we started to recognise that my hair definitely felt stronger, finding that the best results came when we used it following the Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector.</p><p>It's a powerful shampoo though, so if you're prone to scalp conditions then we'd recommend only using it three to four times a month as it gives quite a harsh, deep clean when used too frequently.</p><p>Want to know more about the whole Olaplex range?

And as soon as we felt the creamy gel texture, we knew we were in for a treat.</p><p>Smelling perfumed enough to enjoy, the Fine Hair Shampoo definitely feels luxurious when you apply it, giving you a deep cleanse that doesn't weigh down your hair at all.</p><p>It feels free of any harsh chemicals, leaving your hair soft and stronger from the first wash, without giving you too intense a clean.</p><p>We definitely recommend pairing this with the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fine Hair Conditioner</a>&nbsp;for salon-fresh results – forking out £44 for your hair wash might seem excessive, but you definitely get what you pay for.</p><h2><strong>Hairburst For Longer Stronger Hair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HABU0005H_1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Hairburst For Longer Stronger Hair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo, £27.50 from BeautyBay - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Known for its hair growth vitamins, Hairburst For Longer Stronger Hair Shampoo comes in a duo pack with the matching shampoo for less than £25.</p><p>Not only does Hairburst's shampoo apparently help you achieve stronger hair, but it also strives help it grow longer with added shine. What more could you want?!</p><p>The bottles are actually smaller in real life than they look online, but they're still 350ml which is quite a bit bigger than the size of your classic cheaper haircare.</p><p>You can really smell the hints of avocado and coconut as you cleanse your hair in the shower, leaving it smelling wonderful post-wash too.</p><p>Out of all the shampoos, we were most pleasantly surprised by this duo as our hair was left looking noticeably shinier and softer to the touch after using it just once.</p><p>People might prefer more mature-looking products, but we definitely recommend Hairburst's For Longer Stronger Hair Shampoo & Conditioner Duo for getting fast results.</p><h2>Pureology Hydrate Shampoo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/12594168-2124791427341492.jpg><ul><li><strong>Pureology Hydrate Shampoo, £15.90 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>All of Pureology's haircare is 100 per cent vegan, which is enough of a reason to love its Hydrate Shampoo, even before trying it out.</p><p>Priced just below £16, the Pureology Hydrate Shampoo locks in your hair's moisture, working well for dry hair that's gone through the damage of being dyed.</p><p>We're partial to a full head of highlights every three months, so Pureology's Hydrate Shampoo was literally made for someone like us.</p><p>In terms of the thickness of the texture and the wash it gives your hair, this one's a winner for being better than bog-standard shampoos.</p><p>We can't put our finger on the herbal/floral smell, but all you need to know is that it is good.</p><p>A fault with our hair is that it tends to get greasy quickly but we found that using this Pureology gem, our hair felt moisturised but not oily or greasy, even after a couple of days.</p><p>It's lightweight and nourishing, not with dramatically shiny effects but it definitely has enough long-lasting hydration to win usover.</p><h2>Redken <strong>Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12851007-4654848236119188.jpg><ul><li><strong>Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo, £19.55 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>You might recognise Redken from the hairdressers. Its Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo is crafted with "Salon Expert Concentration".</p><p>Boasting a seven per cent bonding care complex, this shampoo works to reduce any colour fading, deeply conditioning your roots and minimising the appearance of split ends.</p><p>If any shampoo deserves to have 'salon expert' written on the front then it's this one – from the first wash, we were immediately obsessed with it.</p><p>It genuinely made us feel as though we'd had our hair washed at the hairdressers, from the familiar smell (you'll understand if you buy it), to the glossy bounce it gave our mane.</p><p>It might be expensive to splash out on the conditioner along with this shampoo - £36.60 at the time of writing to be precise - but if you only use it once a week or every two weeks, you'll get enough impact out of it and it'll last you for a while.</p><p>We're calling it a self-care investment.</p><p>Not got coloured hair but want to give Redken a try?

We would say so, although for £22.90 it's a little on the pricey side.</p><p>We would recommend trying this with a cheaper conditioner if you can't afford to splash out on the full set, although we're definitely singing Coco & Eve's praises.</p><h2>What should I look for in a shampoo?</h2><p>When shopping for shampoo, consider what you are trying to achieve.</p><p>If you want something that will hydrate your hair, then you're going to want to go for moisturising formulas. Whereas oilier scalps might need a shampoo that isn't going to leave their hair looking oily.</p><p>It's especially important to be more selective when you have more specific needs, such as curly or coloured hair.</p><p>Curly hair needs more loving as it's naturally quite dry, and if you have dyed your hair, you need to ensure you're using colour-treatment shampoos.</p><p>Co-founder of organic beauty brand Odylique Abi Weeds says that using Sulfate-free shampoos can really help tackle greasy hair. She explained, "Sulphates are harsh detergents that work to cut through grease but at the same time, strip the hair and scalp. The scalp responds to this by producing excess sebum (oil), creating a vicious circle of grease. Switch to a natural, organic hair shampoo with ingredients like biodynamic nettle, which has proven scalp benefits. You'll possibly find you need to wash your hair less frequently too because gentler shampoos provoke the excess sebum response."</p><h2>How do I figure out my hair type?</h2><p>Learning about your hair type is really straightforward. If your hair has circular follicles then it is curly, otherwise it's straight or wavy.</p><p>The thickness can also be felt with your hands, it's quite easy to notice whether you have naturally fine hair which needs a shampoo that gives the illusion of thickness and helps maintain growth.</p><p>If your hair gets greasy easily then you probably have an oily scalp, which can be combatted with certain shampoos too, in the same way that dandruff can be reduced with speciality products.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsZGuEcYSQaJmeq6RiwKmtzKmmqKtf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billy-tolley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billy Tolley">&larr;
