They are more like craters than&nbsp;<a href=#>potholes</a> on our estate.</p><p>"It's such a disgrace that <a href=#>emergency vehicles</a> can't get down here and makes us all feel unsafe.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOTORS STORIES">READ MORE MOTORS STORIES</h2><p>"And it’s <a href=#>getting worse and worse and worse</a>."</p><p>Warehouse worker Aaron has lived on the <a href=#>estate in St Osyth</a>, near <a href=#>Clacton-on-Sea</a>, for three years.</p><p>He says Seawick Road is the worst - and estimates there are a <a href=#>hundred&nbsp;potholes&nbsp;just on that 150m stretch</a>.</p><p>Aaron said: "It's like a fairground ride.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>"As soon as my front left wheel goes into one hole my back right wheel is still in another, and it goes on like that all the way.</p><p>"You can't go faster than walking speed or you'll hurt your head on the roof of your car because you're bouncing around so much.</p><p>"It’s an absolute joke. It just makes life a misery. And it’s getting worse and worse and worse all the time."</p><p>Vehicles are regularly damaged by smashing over the bumpy concrete surfaces, it is claimed.</p><h2>'CAN'T LEAVE HOMES'</h2><p>And residents who use wheelchairs or mobility scooters can't leave their homes - so are reliant on neighbours to fetch their shopping.</p><p>Aaron added: "It's a good job we're a very close-knit community who care for and support each other."</p><p>The roads have <a href=#>deteriorated over the last 15 years</a>, residents say.</p><p>Homeowners and renters often contact Tendring District Council, Essex County Council and the company managing the site.</p><p>They say the property firm sometimes arranges for the holes to be filled with rubble - but it washes away again as soon as it rains.</p><p>The site features hundreds of chalets which were originally meant to be holiday homes.</p><p>Residents accept they weren't intended for use over the whole winter - but estimate over 80 percent of people now live there full time.</p><p>The site also has a full-time shop, pub and a laundrette.<br>Paul Lucas, 65, bought The Village Inn pub with his wife Geraldine, 65, in 2017.</p><p>He explained customers from three neighbouring caravan sites can no longer get to the pub so trade has dropped by 40 percent.</p><p>It’s disgusting and seriously unsafe</p><span class=quote-credit>Jay Marsh, windscreen company owner</span><p>He said: “This causes me a lot of stress and it’s so sad for the community. We’ve got loyal customers but they only have so much money.</p><p>“The property company took over the estate and has never contacted me - and I just get the answer phone when I try calling them.”</p><p>Jay Marsh, 53, bought his home on the estate a year ago.</p><p>He runs a windscreen company and worries about carrying glass in his vehicle even though it's carefully packaged and carried in a special rack.</p><p>He said: "This is a real business concern for me.</p><p>"Plus I get woken up three times a night by the noise from tires going or the suspension, or exhausts and the underneath of the cars hitting the ground.</p><p>"It’s disgusting and seriously unsafe.</p><p>Francis Read, 53, is not working as a binman at the moment due to illness.</p><p>He said: "It’s like being imprisoned. I avoid walking because it’s so difficult and I’m frightened I’ll break my leg or even my neck.</p><p>“I end up just sitting in doors unless someone comes and helps me and that’s gutting. We all need to get out and about.</p><h2>'IMPRISONED'</h2><p>Tina Robins, 35, lives on the estate and is a full-time carer for her 60-year-old disabled mum.</p><p>She said: "It's becoming impossible to get mum to my chalet safely. She can't walk on the road and had a bad fall on it.</p><p>"I can't get her wheelchair along it and I'm doing so much damage to my car driving her back and forth."</p><p>Councillor Jeff Bray, the cabinet member for planning at Tendring District Council, said: “We are aware of residents' concerns on the Bel Air estate and have been working with them to see where we can assist; such as by making requests to the site operators to make improvements for them.</p><p>“Whilst we will of course continue to assist where we can, many of the issues faced by residents are not within the district council’s control.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>A spokesperson for Essex Highways, part of Essex County Council, said: "The Bel Air Chalet Estate in St Osyth is made up of private roads and all rights and responsibilities for the maintenance and management of these roads are private."</p><p>The property company that manages the site was contacted for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/aaron-deyer-44-lives-seawick-791288064.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seawick-road-seawick-st-osyth-791288335-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seawick-road-seawick-st-osyth-791288332.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/5bf205d1-f4f2-44ec-b2b9-1d6c5b66c91d-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzfZBwa2ppYGTEsL7SrWSrp5GZeqO%2ByK2YoqZdpby1tM6lnKxlkpq5bq3Iq2Seq6OaxXA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./5-year-old-left-in-hot-car-possibly-for-hours-dies-in-what-police-call-tragic-accident-in-va.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5-Year-Old Child Dies After Being Left in Hot Car in Virginia">&larr;
