One of the fans suspected that she had a good deal of plastic surgery on her face, especially on chin and nose as she was looking different from her usual look.</p><h3><strong>Tristin Mays' Words Against Animal Abuse</strong></h3><p>On 17 September 2018, Tristin posted an Instagram post showing awareness to the cruelty and abuse surrounding China's dog meat trade. The caption stood up against all the fur animals abuse and inhumane killing of farm animals.</p><p>Tristin unhesitantly spoke up and called out people who abuse any animal. She mainly talked about the tradition of China that believes the more fear and pain the dogs suffer before killing them, the better the meat tastes.</p><p>Following the description of the tradition, Tristin criticized the very existence of such a sour tradition and trend that started in 2010. She also added about the petty behavior of people who actually stole/kidnapped dogs from people's properties and yards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="James Hinchcliffe Cutest Dating Confuses Fans He Married Stunning Girlfriend; Meet Wife-To-Be" rel=follow>James Hinchcliffe Cutest Dating Confuses Fans He Married Stunning Girlfriend; Meet Wife-To-Be</a></p><p>Tristin also gave a shout out to Plush Bears Dogs Rescue who put in exhausting efforts in rescuing animals every day.
