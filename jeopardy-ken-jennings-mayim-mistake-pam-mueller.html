If they had just split it, it would have been easier to present."</p><p>Pam also revealed other "champion guest hosts" including herself were interested - who wouldn't be - but hinted execs weren't.</p><p>They wanted to "keep eligibility open" so alums like she and <a href=#>Brad Rutter</a> (one of the top 3 winners of all time) could "play more" since hosts technically can't compete.</p><p>“I did hear that about somebody else [who was interested]” she said.</p><p>She also added that her longtime peer Ken was feeling the pressure when he began: “Ken was super stressed out after Alex’s passing and when he started," but she thinks he's doing a great job.</p><p>"Obviously, they want people who are recognizable and have good personality."</p><p>"If they'd asked, I would have done it - it's harder than it looks," she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/489de6ed-d09b-4e29-a747-8edaa8c070c3.jpg><h2>'DISASTER LOGISTICALLY'</h2><p>Pam was a student at Loyola University when she won the Jeopardy! College Championship in 2000 (scoring a Volvo) and was a semi-finalist in the 2001 <a href=#>Tournament of Champions.</a></p><p>Her game show glory led to her being tapped for the 2019 All-Star Games - the first and so far last team-based tournament - coming in third, and splitting $100K with teammates Colby Burnett&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alan Lin.</p><p>Out of six teams, she lost to <a href=#>Team Ken</a> and Team Brad - his team winning $1M in the special two-week showdown all under the late presenter.</p><p>Pam dished that the team format was a "disaster logistically."</p><p>The groups of three players each were hand-picked by a team captian, which is how Pam ended up playing - and she beat Team <a href=#>Buzzy Cohen</a>, Team Julia Collins, and team Austin Rogers.</p><p>The structure seemed to thrill Alex but it was certainly a production, since the players alternated on stage round by round.</p><p>"Splitting up the game and having three different players play three different rounds was messy."</p><p>“We changed clothes so many times, I was glad to get to wear all the dresses I brought," Pam added - she donned some terrific question mark and exclamation point earings when we spoke.</p><p>"It was kind of crazy, we couldnt have the same person [from our team] play Final Jeopardy! twice."</p><p>"Even just trying to explain it to people" she said, in retrospect, "is chaotic."</p><h2>TEAM ALEX</h2><p>But Pam is so glad she got to play in one of Alex's last major events and she presented him with a gift - a photobook of memories he seemed to love.</p><p>She also went to the estate sale of the late host - who so gracefully helmed the show from 1984 until 2020 - and said Ken asked her to pick up "Alex's USO jacket."</p><p>Since Ken lived abroad growing up it "meant a lot to him to have it."</p><p>But she implied looking back is less complicated than looking forward.</p><h2>'WE'LL SEE'</h2><p>On the new <a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a> airing in October, she said: "I think a lot of the ones who made the most news ended up in it, like the person who <a href=#>wrote most of the answer.</a>"</p><p>“[Executive producer since 2021] <a href=#>Mike Davies</a> has a lot of ideas, we’ll see. How to expand the canon is an ongoing discussion."</p><p>During the reunion weekend in Washington, D.C. - which The U.S. Sun attended - Pam also joked the show is "looking for more viral moments."</p><h2>TWO IS BETTER THAN NONE</h2><p>Ken and Mayim began regularly filling in for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>legendary Alex</a>&nbsp;in 2021 after his tragic 2020 passing at age 80 and a whirlwind of Season 37 celebrity guest hosts.</p><p>They included&nbsp;<a href=#>Savannah Guthrie</a>, fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>LeVar Burton</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dr. Oz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, and many more who each scored a week or so at it.</p><p>The search also landed on&nbsp;<a href=#>former executive producer Mike Richards</a>&nbsp;who scored the host gig from the inside before the shocking decision was "reversed" a week later when his&nbsp;<a href=#>misogynistic comments were unearthed.</a></p><p>When Richards was ousted as both host and EP, he was replaced by Davies who is implimenting many of the show's new ideas like the <a href=#>"run a category" bonus.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Mayim began hosting the primetime spinoff&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a> starting September 25th - she's hosting the regular show in the new year.</p><p>Ken is also hosting the&nbsp;<a href=#>Second Chance Tournament</a>&nbsp;airing next month and the weightier&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;beginning October 31st.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-27-at-4.49.38-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/fans-slam-celebrity-spinoff-cringe-763641403-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/4a6be2bf-70e1-4cb1-86fe-552d55723433.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huY2aCeX6SaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmalka62rnnMoqqtmZuaerGtzGakrp2cobKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon-with-twins.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon with Twins">&larr;
