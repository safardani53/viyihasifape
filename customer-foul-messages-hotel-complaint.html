How were you expecting them to respond?"</p><p>Another said: "Good for them!"</p><p>But a third posted: "Disgusting response really. How rude.

She threw the first insult."</p><p>And Charlee told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KentOnline</a>: "I personally go by reviews when I book somewhere to stay, and I felt people should be made aware of how the hotel are treating their customers.</p><p>"People post enough complaints about having a 'bad curry' and I’m not one to slate a business, but this was totally unacceptable."</p><p>James, who charges upwards of £45 a night, added: "The guest was clearly not happy with the answers that I gave to her questions and demands even though they were clear and concise.</p><p>"It was clear to me that she is a needy and entitled individual.</p><p>"We have had an extremely busy summer with 100 per cent occupancy for the last four months solid.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"The hotel staff have had a lot of stress to deal with but have tried their hardest to keep customers happy.</p><p>"It is only fair that they are treated with respect and it is my job to protect them from arrogant customers like this one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoZ3f5Fub2pnk6rAtbvMnqlmnp%2BquW65xKyqmp%2BVqHqpu9Oeo2abn6K9ra3Ip6to</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./samuel-r-delany.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Samuel R.
