On the contrary, she had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">learned to cook</a> from him and utilized it to start&nbsp;a mini cooking series on her Instagram during the pandemic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She noted she had felt a little off during the pandemic when her father called her and suggested she try cooking again, a hobby she had forgotten about.&nbsp;So she did.</p><p>The actress shared all the recipes that her father had taught her as a kid. In the first video, she taught her fans to cook “banged up veg [vegetables].”&nbsp;In another tutorial of herself making toast, she gave all the advice her father had passed down to her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>“A crucial part of this recipe that I got taught very early on from my father is that there’s no point in having a good piece of toast unless you’ve got good butter with it, too,” said Florence.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Florence Pugh’s Dad?</h2><p>Pugh’s dad is more than just a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">successful restaurateur</a>.&nbsp;Clinton is said to have single-handedly transformed Cowley Road in&nbsp;Oxford, England, into the cool hub it is now.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The restaurateur came from a family with a catering background, and his parents once owned and managed a modest hotel. So he always knew he wanted to work in catering, and he earned a diploma in restaurant design.</p><p>With passion and hard work, Clinton opened the glamorous Baedekers to Cornmarket, the Mexican La Cantina Kazbar, and Cafe Baba.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also had a&nbsp;fine dining establishment, The Lemon Tree on Woodstock Road, the sophisticated Grand Cafe on the High Street, and many more. But the most famous one was Cafe Coco.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Clinton built Cafe Coco from the ground up, and it has a special place in his heart. He designed the entire cafe on his own and opened it in 1992.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, in 2019, the designer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sold some of his restaurants</a> even though they were doing well. At 61, Clinton was tired and wanted to take a break.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Clinton Pugh Is a Loving Father</h2><p>One would probably think that with that many restaurants to manage, Clinton sacrificed his family for his career. But that’s not true.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Florence Pugh with dad and mom at the Oscar.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Clinton is a family man who loves his children and wife dearly. Apart from Florence, he is also a father to Arabella Gibbins,&nbsp;Toby Sebastian, and Rafaela Pugh.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In August 2022, during an episode of&nbsp;Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge, the&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;star said her parents and siblings <a href=# rel="follow noopener">moved from England to Spain</a> during her childhood because of health reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed she had asthma and tracheomalacia, which caused breathing issues. The doctors advised that a hotter climate would be better.&nbsp;And so the Pugh family packed up and moved to Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>“My parents were young and had three kids and decided to just ‘vamanos.’ So I want to do that when I’m older, as well. It’s such a nice way of just thinking and looking at things, and just picking up and going and living somewhere,” said the actress.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6cpL%2BmusKeZKmtl516pa3DZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./serena-deeb-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is The AEW Star Married?">&larr;
