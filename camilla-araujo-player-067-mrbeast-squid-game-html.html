Player 067 is a popular character in the original Korean drama series.</p><p>In the show, the character Kang Sae-byoek, otherwise known as player 067, was portrayed by Korean actress&nbsp;HoYeon Jung.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>MrBeast's version of the show became <a href=# rel=follow>a viral hit</a> on YouTube, amassing millions of views within hours. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>With the popularity of the adapted gig, player 067 started trending online as many people lost their patient while trying to learn about Araujo.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This led Araujo, who was limited to being an aspiring model before her newfound glory,&nbsp;to post a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Q&A video</a> on her YouTube channel on December 02, 2021.</p><p>During the Q&A session, Araujo was asked many questions by her curious fans, including whether MrBeast's rendition of the show was scripted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Was MrBeast's 'Squid Game' Scripted?</h2><p>Before recording her Q&A session, Araujo posted an Instagram story requesting&nbsp;her fans to pose questions for her.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet personality selected a handful of questions and responded to them in her YouTube video, which apparently is her first upload on her channel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Araujo's YouTube channel is currently subscribed by 412,000 users, while&nbsp;the said video has amassed&nbsp;18,272 views at the time of the writing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The first question she hand-picked to answer was the obvious one. Araujo was asked how she was chosen to be in&nbsp;MrBeast's video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In her response, the model-turned YouTuber said she is "really good friends" with some of MrBeast's video production team members.</p><p>The team members asked Araujo if she would like to participate in the recreation of the popular&nbsp;game depicted in the series.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Araujo told the team that she was "absolutely" ready to join the roster as a participant.</p><p>The most intriguing question followed then after as Araujo was asked if "the game was scripted."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The model took a short pause before answering the question and&nbsp;then denied MrBeast's show being fixed beforehand.</p><p>If it was scripted, I would have won. Or if it was scripted 456 would have won. You already know,&nbsp;I had a little deal with 456. And I would have gotten half of that. So, no it wasn't scripted. I wish â€” that would be better for me.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Camilla Araujo's Beef with Player 431</h2><p>Araujo's fans were eager to know what exactly happened between her and player 431 as the talk of their beef started making rounds on the internet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to Araujo, she was together with player 431 since the beginning of the filming.</p><p>Over time, the production team noted how they were "super close" with one another on the show's set.</p><p>The show's creator and host, <a href=# rel=follow>MrBeast</a>, even revealed Araujo and player 431, whom the model referred to as Britney, to be roommates and best friends. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the supposed beef can be traced back to when the two were paired to play the marbles.</p><p>As per Araujo, Britney explained how player 067 faired in the Marbles game during the Netflix show and told Ajauro to play along the lines.</p><p>In the Korean drama, player 067's friend sacrificed her chance to advance so that she would move further in the game. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But unfortunately, Britney did not perform as planned, resulting in Player 067's elimination from MrBeast's show.</p><p>Araujo clarified Britney's act did not "ultimately ruin our&nbsp;friendship," and therefore, the two are still on good terms.</p><p>"Everybody calm down. We are all good. She is all good. There is no beef," clarified Ajauro and asked her followers to&nbsp;"stop trying to start things." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJuRoratuMBmmKuZpZ%2B8brzLmrCeql1lg3h5zKuZnpmjqXq0vdSim2afkaKyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-juanpa-zurita-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Juanpa Zurita Dating Now">&larr;
