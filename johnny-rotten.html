He is the son of Eileen Lydia and John Christopher Lydon. He spent his summer vacations in his mother’s native County Cork, where he was harassed for having an English accent, despite the fact that he travels under an Irish passport. Because his mother was ill on a regular basis, John was obligated to look after his four brothers as the firstborn. As a child, he was a member of a neighborhood gang and was frequently involved in fights with other groups.</p><p>He’d poop in his pants. He was too afraid to ask the teacher to excuse him from class. Lydon contracted spinal meningitis when he was seven years old, and he spent a year in St Ann’s Hospital in Haringey, London, experiencing hallucinations and severe memory loss that lasted four years.</p><p>The nurses used a needle to draw fluid out of his spine as part of his treatment. He got his first job at the age of ten as a minicab dispatcher for a year because his family was struggling financially. He finished his O-levels at school and got into a fight with his father, who didn’t like Lydon’s long hair, so he dyed it bright green instead. He was expelled from school at the age of fourteen after an altercation with a teacher and went to Hacky College.</p><h2>John Joseph Age, Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Johnny Rotten</strong> was born on January 31, 1956, he is 66 years old as of 2023.
